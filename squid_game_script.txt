Original release date: September 17, 2021
The sixth and final game is the Squid Game, with Gi-hun on offense and Sang-woo on defense. Gi-hun beats Sang-woo, but refuses to complete the game. He invokes the third clause to end the game, but Sang-woo stabs himself and asks Gi-hun to use the prize money to help Sang-woo’s mother. Gi-hun returns home to find his mother already dead. A year later, Gi-hun is still traumatized by his experience and has barely touched his prize money. One night he receives a gold game invitation card, and in answering it finds Player 001, Oh Il-nam, still alive but dying. Il-nam is one of the VIPs, the “Host” (who co-ran the game alongside the Front Man, In-ho), and the mastermind behind the game operation, which was made to entertain the bored super rich like himself. Il-nam explains that both the poverty-stricken and uber-wealthy lead monotonous lives and he was trying to find a way to derive enjoyment from life. He was also testing whether humanity had any innate goodness left in it, reminding Gi-hun that despite witnessing the bloodshed in the initial game, he and the other participants still returned and sacrificed each other’s lives for the sake of earning the prize money for themselves. The specific games are based on Il-nam’s childhood memories, and he decided to participate himself for nostalgia’s sake. Il-nam asks Gi-hun to play one last game with him, another test to see if humanity has goodness left in it – whether anyone will help a drunk man on the street before midnight; Gi-hun wins but Il-nam dies, though presumably not before he witnesses his loss. Gi-hun snaps out of his stupor and fulfils his promises: he gets Sae-byeok’s brother out of the orphanage and gives Sang-woo’s mother his share of the prize money. Gi-hun is about to leave the country to reconnect with his daughter, but on the way sees someone playing ddakji with the same game recruiter who invited him. Gi-hun takes the man’s card and calls the number, now determined to find out who they are.

[dramatic music continues]
[masked manager] Player 218 and Player 456, welcome to the final game. Before we begin, we’ll flip a coin to decide who plays offense or defense. Please choose a shape. Triangle or square.
Triangle.
[coin clangs, whooshes]
[masked manager] It’s triangle. Please choose either offense or defense.
[inhales sharply]
Offense.
[masked manager] Player 456 will play offense. Player 218 will defend.
[door clangs]
[masked manager] For the final game, you’ll both be playing Squid Game.
[VIP 1] Squid Game.
What an odd name.
[Front Man] It was originally a children’s game that was played in Korea many years ago.
[VIP 1] Hmm.
[masked manager] Let me explain the rules of Squid Game.
One, the attacker must enter the squid shape court, run past the defense, and then tap the area inside the squid’s head with his foot to secure the win.
Two, the defender must block the attacker’s advance and force them outside of the court’s bounds in order to win.
Three, if a situation arises, in which either player is unable to continue playing the game, the last one standing will be the winner.
A player’s unable to continue.
Could you explain that?
[masked manager] That would be referring to the player’s death. And now, with that, let the game begin.
[suspenseful music]
[Front Man] Among all the games that kids played back then, it was the most physical and violent.
So any kind of violence is allowed?
Sure. There are no restrictions.
[suspenseful music continues]
[inhales deeply]
[breathes deeply]
[in English] Why is he hopping on one foot?
[Front Man] The attacker is given a handicap. He can only hop on one foot until he crosses the squid’s neck.
Oh, so the defender tries to block him.
[Front Man] Yes. That’s the first challenge of this game.
[in Korean] We always used to play this as kids.
[heavy breath]
When we cross… do you remember what we used to call it?
Shut up. Who cares about all that?
[Sang-woo grunts, screams]

I put an end to her suffering. You know she would have died anyway.
That’s bullshit. Stop lying. She could’ve survived. They would’ve treated her.
I know what you’re like, okay? You’re the reason that I had to kill her. I knew you two would stop all this, so she didn’t die in there.
Was that it? You killed someone because this might end?
Yeah! You and that girl would have been the majority you needed to get out! Going home without a single cent. I couldn’t do that!
She’s the one who stopped me. ‘Cause I was gonna kill you with this. It’s over. I won’t let you leave here with that money.

It’s the damn place where they made us play Red Light, Green Light.
So many people played with us, but now they’re dead.
Everyone except for us, Gi-hun.
[groans]
We… we’ve already come too far to end this now.
[screams]
[both grunting]

[Sang-woo cries in pain]
So it was you that killed them. You… you killed everyone! You killed them. You’re the one who killed them.

[dramatic music swells]
I can’t.
[breathes deeply]
I wanna end here.
[VIP 1] What is he doing?
[VIP 2] What the hell?
[VIP 3] What’s going on?
[in Korean] Clause Three of the agreement.
The players are able to end the game when… the majority agrees.
[pants]
So if we both give up now, you have to end it, right?
[exhales]
[in English] Player 456 wants to stop the game.
He’s giving up the prize money right… right here at the very edge of victory?
No fucking way.
Sang-woo.
[in Korean] I just thought… how they used to call our names when… our moms had made supper for us.
That won’t happen again.
[somber music]
Let’s go.
Let’s go together.

Gi-hun.

No, Sang-woo. Don’t talk. [Gi-hun crying]
My mother, go help her.
Don’t talk, Sang-woo.
[Gi-hun crying]
You have to help her.
[Gi-hun] Ah… No. Don’t…
Sang-woo, don’t… Oh, no! [crying]
[wailing]
No! Sang-woo, no…
[crying]
[Gi-hun screaming]
[somber music]
You should celebrate.
That was quite the game there.
[Gi-hun] Why? Why did you do it? How can you?
You bet on horses. It’s the same here but… we bet on humans. You’re our horses.
I did not expect you to finish your race.
Who are you?
It was a dream. Just think of it that way. And it really wasn’t a bad one for you, either.
[Gi-hun] Who are you?
[In-ho breathes deeply]
[Gi-hun] Who are you?
[steam hissing]
[exhales]
Who are you?
[gasps]
[chokes]
Who are you? Who are… [breathing heavily]
[evangelist] Believe in Jesus or burn in Hell!
You fool who deny the Lord’s existence, repent now! The day of judgment is upon us! Followers go to Heaven, non-believers burn in Hell! The only thing waiting for you in the afterlife will be fire and pain! Let us repent and kneel down before the Lord! Save yourself from Hell by making Jesus your lord!
[suspenseful music]

[sighs]
Hold on. Wait right here.
[panting]
Here’s some mackerel. I know your mother may want it.
[pensive music]
[breathes deeply]
She came down with something, I think. She hasn’t come out to work. And it’s been a few days since she’s answered her phone. I should’ve stopped by to check on her. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. I mean, I, uh…
[gasps] It’s all right. Give your mom any cash you got. She needs it more than I do.
[pensive music continues]
[Sang-woo’s mom] Gi-hun.

We’ve got a real barista working for us here, and he can make you a cup as well. I’m not sure if you’d like it that much. [chuckles]
[bank manager chuckles]
Why am I here to see you?
[gasps]
Uh, sorry, you had to take the trip here. I wanted to have a car sent out to you, but…
Why am I here? What’s wrong?
Uh, well…
[sucks teeth, inhales]
So you see, you created your account here quite a while ago and… and you haven’t made that much effort to contact us since.
What do you mean? Did I do something wrong?
Huh? Uh, uh, no. It’s nothing like that, sir. [chuckles] Uh, you’ve got all your money set up in a normal savings account. You weren’t earning all that much interest on it. And recently, our bank began offering these consultations for VIPs looking to expand their financial assets. I wanted to let you know that we’re here to help.
[chuckles]
I’m sure you’re keeping busy. I just wanted to say…
Oh. I’m sorry. Did I offend you?
Could you help me out with something else?
Okay, what can we do?
Please spare me just 10,000 won?
What?
Uh…
All right, yeah. Here, let me just…
[bank manager] Um…
[distant train rumbling]
[water sloshing]
[woman] Excuse me. Would you buy some flowers? Please, mister. I need to get rid of them tonight or they’ll end up wilting away.
Thank you, mister. I appreciate it.
Uh, here.

Please, Gi-hun.
[heart rate monitor beeping]
[Il-nam gulping water]
Who are you? You explain this.
[gulps]
[Il-nam breathing heavily]
You see him? That man down there?
He must be drunk… because he’s been sitting there for hours.
He looks homeless too if I had to guess.
You… Were you the one who’s behind it?
He’s going to freeze to death if he stays out there any longer. And no one is going over to help or anything.
Why the hell did you do it?
[breathes deeply]
Would you help out that guy?
Answer me!
[shaky breathing]
Why did you do that to us?
You think that you will stop walking and help that disgusting, stinking drunk, little piece of trash, huh?
[shouts angrily] Show me who you are! Why did I get to live and no one else?
Listen. Let’s play something tonight. That man out there… if he remains out there until midnight, I win. If anyone… goes to help the drunk before then, in that case, you win.
Cut the crap, okay?
[Gi-hun breathing shakily]
[Il-nam grunting]
I could easily snap your neck right here.
[grunts] If you do that, then you won’t get to hear my explanation for all this.
[shaky breathing]
Play this game with me and… I’ll give you the… answer to your question.
[shaky breathing]
[Il-nam grunts]
[Gi-hun breathes deeply]
[Il-nam breathing heavily]
[wind gusting]
[clock ticking]
And if I win…
[inhales deeply]
…then I’ll kill you without a second thought.
What will you… bet on it with then?
Anything.
[inhales sharply]
It doesn’t matter. You might as well take everything I have.
[breathing heavily]
[ticking]
[heart rate monitor beeping]
So then… who are you?
I earn… a living, lending out money.
You give money to people for a living…
[inhales deeply]
…and you get rich doing it?
Money. [chuckles] You know what making money is like. It’s not simple to do.
So then… was any of what you said true or was it all just a lie?
Oh Il-nam. Is that even your real name, huh?
[Il-nam] It is. Yes, that’s real. Oh Il-nam. [inhales] That tumor’s also real. And it also had gotten larger too. That’s true. And the house I used to live with my family in was almost exactly like that one in the alley. That’s all true.
[wind gusting]
[sighs]
[inhales] Can you still… trust anybody to be good even after everything you’ve been through?
Why did you send a card?
I heard that all the money you won is just sitting there and that you are still living like you used to. Is it all just because you feel guilty?
Guilt? Shut up.
You don’t feel any guilt for what you did, do you?
It’s yours now. That cash is your reward for your hard work and luck. And you have every right to use it now.
Life goes by quick.
In one minute… gone in a blink.
[wind gusts]
[ticking]
[heart rate monitor beeping]
[breathing deeply]
[exhales]
[Gi-hun] Why did you do something like this?
[Il-nam] Do you know what someone who doesn’t have any money has in common with someone with too much money to know what to do with?
[labored breathing]
Living is… no fun for either of them.
If you have too much money, then it… doesn’t matter what you buy, or eat, or drink, or whatever.
[chuckles]
Everything, well, it all gets boring. All of my clients, started to eventually say the exact same things whenever we talked. Everybody felt… that there was no joy in their lives anymore. And so, we decided to get together. We did a little bit of thinking. What could we all do to… finally have some fun?
Some fun? You put us through all of that so you can have fun?
[Il-nam] It seems… that you forgot how… no one had to play, and you… all put your signatures on the agreement. And that you all made your decision to come back on your own.
[Il-nam breathing heavily]
[ticking]
[Il-nam] Well, he’s still out there. It looks like you’ve run out of luck. Tell me… you still trust… in humanity being good?
[Gi-hun] I wanna know… I wanna know why you joined us?
[inhales]
Oh, well, in my childhood I always had so much fun out doing things with all of my friends. We’d lose track of time for hours. I wanted to just… feel something just one last time before I die. And you are not going to get that feeling if you are just going to spectate. And I desperately wanted that.
And so… did playing do that then?
Hell yeah. You asked why I let you live. By joining… and playing with you… I got that chance to… feel again. Thanks to you… I got to remember all these things that I had… forgotten long ago.
[ticking]
It had been such a long time… since I… was able to have that much fun.
[ticking]

[Gi-hun] You saw that, didn’t you? You saw that you lost.
[clock chimes]
[Il-nam sighs, clears throat]
[grunts]
[exhales]
And our guests, greet them for me, all right?
[Front Man] Of course, sir, but why not do it yourself?
Because I know that I’m not going to have as much fun watching as playing.

INCREASE IN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD DEBT RANKING KOREA 2ND GLOBALLY
[female reporter] The country’s reported household debt is rapidly on the rise, topping the current global average. Last third quarter, the Bank of Korea and the Bank for International Settlements…
[hairdresser] Hmm.
…reported that the GDP…
Holy moly! Your hair, sir, grew out. Uh, what you’re getting done today? Did you want a shorter cut? Or keep it longer so we can perm it like that, huh?
[female reporter] …Bank for international Settlements. The biggest increase in the world besides China. The reason for the steep rise in Korea’s reported household debt is due, at least in part, to the lifted government restrictions on financial loans.

Does that mean you know where she is right now?

[Sang-woo’s mom] Is this the boy?
Yeah.
Tell me your name, sweetie.
It’s Cheol. Kang Cheol.
Kang Cheol? [gasps]
How cool! That’s a manly name you have there. And you look so tough and strong.
Take care of him, please.
Okay. It’ll be nice to have a little extra company around for dinner for a change. Don’t worry about me. Have a good trip.
Thanks.
Cheol, have you had dinner yet? Here, come. Come and take a seat. Come on now. Have a fish bun. Here you go.
Oh, goodness! That jacket is way too light for this cold. Wait, don’t you have a warmer jacket?

Of course, of course, I got you a present. [chuckles] No way. It’s a secret. I’ll show it to you in person.

Why’d you do that?

Why go up and push that guy?
[scoffs]
You got lucky waiting in the back of the line.
Must have forgotten how things are here.
What if that guy ended up wasting our time on that one step like that criminal?
Would you have done nothing?
But he was on the last tile.
He would move to the next one soon.
How can you know that, huh?
That last guy could tell the tempered glass apart the whole time, but he watched all those poor bastards out there die.
The only reason you and I even made it is ’cause he could tell the tiles apart.
Come on! Just stop it with this bullshit.
That guy is not the reason that I’m still here, okay?
I’ll tell you the reason.
It’s that I’m willing to do almost anything to win this.
Stop with the excuses. I’m not buying it.
You still killed someone. His bullet is in your hands.
Get it together, huh.
We’ll be killing everyone if we want that money.
Think about it for just one second.
You should be happy that there’s someone who’s not afraid to get his hands dirty.
And if it were me on that tile?
[groans] Come on!
Gi-hun!
Your life is so damn pathetic, and here’s why.
It’s because you always gotta open your mouth and ask something idiotic.
Because you’re a nosy-ass idiot who’s too slow to keep it shut.
Someone who always has to get into trouble but somehow can’t tell he’s in it.
Okay.
That’s right. That’s how I got caught in all this.
Because I was slow, crazy incompetent.
Just a dimwit who lives off his mother, but you’re with me in this place.
Isn’t that interesting?
Why is that?
Ssangmun-dong’s golden child, the genius Cho Sang-woo, who went to SNU was here?
Rolling around this shithole, slamming with us, simpletons, huh!
Is it my fault that you’re here?

[Chief] Jun-ho!
It’s me, Chief.
Where the hell are you?
Can you hear me all right, sir?
I haven’t seen or heard from you in days!
Just hold on, I’ll explain it later.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Look, I’m somewhere southwest of the mainland.
What?
Can you try to locate my signal?
Put a whole team together for this.
What?
A whole team?
[Jun-ho] I need backup.
You gotta get a whole squad. The police, coast guard, everyone.
[Chief] What did you say? I can’t hear you!
Let me send over a couple of things, okay, and take a look.
Slow it down…
I’ll call you again soon.
What did you do…

[Front Man] I don’t know.
Have the Korean police ever been quick to act?
And besides, you barely get any signal around here.
I don’t know what you tried to send, but I doubt it went through.
Come and turn yourself in. You’ll get a plea bargain with that.
If you drop your gun right now and hand over the phone,
I might let you live.
[Jun-ho] Stop right there.
[Jun-ho panting]
That gun of yours holds five bullets.
But for police regulations, one chamber must remain empty, and one must be filled with a blank.
That leaves three live rounds.
You’ve already used one to kill a man and another one to break the lock.
Which means that there’s only one bullet left in your gun.
One bullet is more than enough to kill you.

[classical music playing on speakers]
[breathes deeply]
[dishes clatter]
[classical music rising]
[soft waltz music playing on speakers]
[soft waltz music continues]
[soft waltz music ends]
[Front Man] Give up.
[Jun-ho] I warned you.
Take another step and…
[gunshot]
[breathes heavily]
[Front Man] This is over.
Now come with me.
[breathing shakily]
[Front Man] Do as I say.
Or you die.
Who the hell… are you?
[dramatic music]
[dramatic music continues]
In-ho.
Let’s go.
[gasps]
Make this easy.
[dramatic music rising]
[Jun-ho] Brother…
In-ho, why?
[gunshot]
[tense music]
[water splashing]
[waves crashing]
[sighs]
[Gi-hun] Sae-byeok.
[shaky breath]
It’s all right.
I didn’t come here to kill you.
You’ve been dozing off.
I’d have killed you already if I wanted to.
[Sae-byeok breathing heavily]
I have this with me because of Sang-woo there.
Protection, you know.
[Sae-byeok breathing heavily]
You’re not holding up too well, huh?
No, it’s okay. I feel fine.
So how come you barely touched your food earlier?
It wasn’t very well cooked, that’s all.
[breathing shakily]
Stop lying, please.
And if I’m hurt?
Are you gonna try to treat it?
[Sae-byeok gulps]
You need to think about yourself.
Just leave me. I’ll be okay.
[Gi-hun breathes deeply]
[whispers] Hey, Kang Sae-byeok.
We should stick together.
We can beat him.
Whatever the game, we’ll help each other get through this as teammates.
Show that psychopath what we can do.
Share all that prize money and just run away.
And do you know what you’re gonna do with all that money once we get out?
I’d pay my debt off first.
And buy a nice clean store in the city for my mom.
[deep inhale]
She always hoped to run a, a real store, not just the kind of little stall.
And I would… finally start being a dad to my girl… for once in my life.
How old is your daughter?
She’s ten.
That’s also how old my little brother is.
And where is your brother staying now?
In orphanage.
I promised that he’d get out of there soon.
Our mother is stuck in the North right now.
I said I’d get her once I was able to make enough money, and I’ll get us all a house.
There’s so much in there. I think even with half, you’ll have plenty.
Hey, Gi-hun.
I think you and I should make a deal.
[Gi-hun] What kind of deal?
Just in case either of us… can actually make it out of this hellhole somehow, we’ll look after each other’s loved ones, okay?
Don’t say that. Come on.
We’ll beat Sang-woo, and then, we’ll get out of here together.
[Sae-byeok inhales deeply]
I still want you to swear, though.
[quiet sob]
I need you to swear that you’ll look after him.
Shh.
[somber music]
[knife thuds]
[inhales deeply]
[thrilling music]
[Sae-byeok] Don’t do it.
That isn’t you.
You’re a good person at heart.
[dramatic music]
[exhales]
[Sae-byeok gasping]
[Gi-hun sighs]
[dull thud]
[Gi-hun gasps]
[Sae-byeok groaning]
[Gi-hun] Hey.
Hey, what’s wrong?
Hey, you’re… you’re…
[moaning]
You’re…
What happened? When?
When did you get hurt?
[groans]
Shit.
[Sae-byeok] Mister.
Huh?
I think I wanna go. I’d like to go home now.
[breathes heavily]
Hey, hold on, Sae-byeok. Stay here.
Don’t let yourself go. Just keep on holding this.
I’ll go get someone, okay?
[panting]
Hey, hey! We need help.
She’s lost a lot of blood!
Somebody get in here!
There’s a badly injured girl!
Is anybody out there?
[breathing heavily]
Get in here, you assholes!
Someone’s dying! Hello?
Send help in!
You need her alive if you want her in the next round!
Somebody out there, please, answer me!
[panting]
[door alarm blares]
[Gi-hun] Oh. Hey!
Could you please get a doctor? She’s lost a lot of blood.
Hurry! Please.
She’s…
[breathing heavily]
[suspenseful music]
[dramatic music]
Sae-byeok.
[breathing shakily]
Sae… Sae-byeok.
Sae-byeok.
No.
Oh, no. Oh, Sae-byeok. [sobs]
Oh, no. Sae-byeok, no.

[“Fly Me to the Moon” instrumental playing](\^**^/)(\^**^/)Original release date: September 17, 2021
The players return to the dorm where Mi-nyeo is waiting, having been allowed to sit out the game. Player 069, who beat his wife in the marble game, commits suicide. The VIPs arrive and are welcomed by the Front Man on behalf of his boss, the host. The VIPs are wealthy patrons who gamble on the games. Jun-ho takes a worker’s place and one of the VIPs attempts to have sex with him, but Jun-ho interrogates the VIP for info and escapes the island with a scuba kit. In the fifth game the players, in predetermined order, have 16 minutes to cross a bridge with panels of either tempered or normal glass. The players at the front die off as the panels are tested. When Deok-su gets to the front of the line, he refuses to move; Mi-nyeo grabs him and they fall together. With four players left, Sang-woo pushes Player 017, killing him to reveal the last trick panel. Gi-hun, Sang-woo and Sae-byeok complete the game.

[radio beeps]
The intruder?
[masked man] We haven’t located him yet, sir.
[radio beeps]
[Front Man sighs]
[beeps]
Make sure you catch him. The VIPs will arrive soon.
[sighs]
[dark music]
[scoffs]
[exhales]
Deok-su, honey, so glad you won.
[stammers] How… how the hell…
What?
You’re looking at me like you’ve seen a ghost. Are you okay?
[scoffs]
[inhales]
The masked guys all called me this, “the weakest link.”
Like when nobody chooses you as a partner for things when you were a kid.
Hey, this guy knows about it.
The weakest link!
[Mi-nyeo cackles]
And after that, they gently escorted me back to this dorm.
[laughs]
Because… they said that it’s all a part of a rule that… in the old days… not to let a kid turn into some kind of an outcast, I guess.
Goddamn it! [inhales]
It’s amazing, isn’t it?

I’m happy to hear you enjoy the game, sir.
Yes, sir. The host is currently waiting for the VIPs to arrive.
[clanks]
[footsteps receding]
[tense music]
[gun cocks]
[mysterious music]
[Front Man, in Korean] Are you in here right now?
You’re good, but you made one mistake.
I always put the receiver down the other way.
[eerie music]
The bullet you shot was from a Smith and Wesson M60 revolver, standard issue for Korean police.
What’s a cop doing here without a partner?
[inhales]
[exhales] I am sure you have lots of questions.
It’s not too late to come out and talk.
I don’t know how you got in, but you can’t leave this place without my permission.

[masked man] We found a body.
Where is it?
The northern coast of the island.

[Sae-byeok sniffles]

[Sang-woo] Don’t worry about it.
He was an old man you only knew for a few days.
[Sang-woo exhales]
See that man there?
His partner was his wife.

[masked man 1] We found this police ID on him.

[masked man 2] The VIPs have arrived.
[radio beeps]
[Front Man] Incinerate the body.
[sniffles] Let…
Let’s just stop all this. I can’t keep doing this. I can’t.
[crying]
The majority must agree. Well, come on, let’s get out.
Half of us, that’s all we need to end this right now.
Don’t any of you want to leave this horrible place?
Anyone who wants to go, stand up. Let’s get out of here.
[whimpering]
How can you call yourselves human?
[crying]
How many of you can continue with this insanity just for the money?
You just had to kill the ones you were the closest to at this place, and you’re good with that just to get the money?
[cries]
[Sang-woo] So what if we stop now?
You think your wife will stop being dead if we all go now?
And she’ll forgive you for letting her get murdered?
If you can’t keep going, then why are you alive right now?
You should’ve been the one who died in there instead.
See that?
That’s the price of being in here.
And your wife and the others paid it with their lives.
No.
And you wanna go and leave?
You wanna start from the beginning again?
You ready to do all that, huh?
[sobs]
Starting over again from nothing with that guilt.
[Player 69 whimpers]
And is everybody here ready to do that as well?
Go ahead, stand up! Let’s see who thinks they are.
[Sang-woo] Get up and get out of here!
[Player 69 whimpers]
[heavy breathing]
[Player 69 sobs]
[Player 69] No…
[Player 69 crying]
[dramatic music]
[helicopter whirring]
[knocks on door]
[door opens]
[Front Man] The VIPs have arrived outside.
[elevator dings]
[in English] Greetings.
I hope your long trip here has not been too difficult.
I am the Front Man.
I oversee all of the operations here at this facility.
It is a true honor to welcome you.
Where is the host?
Regrettably, some urgent business has prevented him from attending.
Seriously?
I find it hard to believe the host would miss a night like tonight.
[Front Man] He asked me to apologize on his behalf.
Did some problem happen here?
Not at all.
It’s just a personal matter of the host.
The remaining games will be held as scheduled.
I’m sure you won’t be disappointed.
Well, I hope not.
Listen, I’m willing to give anybody some slack. That’s not a problem.
I just have to say that I’m a difficult man to please.
I hope you won’t disappoint me.
[Front Man sighs]
[Front Man] Shall we?
[door beeps]
[door rumbling]
[footsteps receding]
[Player 244, in Korean] Oh, Lord, be my shepherd, be my guide.
May you watch over me tonight.
May you give me protection and strength that I need to make my way through these routes, and may you light the path to my salvation.
I give myself to you, Oh Lord.
Please look down on me with pity and forgiveness.
I pray for those who have sacrificed themselves for me, or forgive them as well.
Hear me, Oh Lord, help me and forgive me for what I have done and what I may do.
I live with my heart only by your graces.
I am your humble servant, and I seek repentance for my sins.
Oh, God, protect me and save my soul.
I know I’m a sinner, but I seek holy absolution in your light.
[door bangs]
[VIP 1, in English] I am dying to know what this next game is.
Give us a hint, will you?
[Front Man] As much as I’d like to, sir, I’d hate to ruin the fun for everyone.
[VIP 2] The games of this edition have been amazing.
[VIP 3] Right. The contest in Korea was the best.
[Front Man] Thank you.
I believe this next game will exceed your expectations.
[VIP 1] Well, that’s why we came all this way.
Trust me. The screens we have at home are plenty big, but… nothing beats seeing with your own eyes.
[VIP 4] No!
No, don’t do it, you idiot! You asshole!
Fucking loser!
What are you so worked up about?
I put a lot of money on that dickhead to win.
Oh!
[VIP 2 laughs] How much did you bet?
[VIP 4] A million bucks!
[VIP 2] Ooh.
What convinced you to bet so much on number 69?
Oh, it’s, uh, such a beautiful number, 69.
[VIPs laugh]
[VIP 1] Oh, you dirty dog.
Oh.
[Front Man] You can place your bets again before the next game begins.
Why don’t you all get some rest in your rooms?
We’ll come and get you when everything’s ready.
[VIP 1] I’m looking forward to it.
[VIP 5] So, will you bet on brain or muscle?
[VIP 2] So who you’re putting your money on this time?
[VIP 6] I think I’m going muscle all the way.
[VIP 1] I still haven’t decided yet.
[VIP 5] Number 101.
What about you?
I’m torn between a couple of them.
[VIP 4] Sixty-two, I think.
[glasses clinking]
[eerie music]
[in Korean] Your shift’s over.

[woman on PA] Player 69, eliminated.
[scoffs]
[digital trilling]
[beeping]
[woman on PA] Attention, all players. The fifth game is about to begin.
All players, follow the staff’s instructions and swiftly make your way towards the game hall.
[“The Blue Danube” playing on speakers]
[mumbling prayers]
[“The Blue Danube” continues playing]
[VIP 2, in English] So how are your scores so far? Bet on any winners?
[VIP 4 sighs] No.
For some reason, I keep picking losers.
[VIP 2] Now is your chance to catch up.
The serious betting starts in this round.
And how much you gonna bet?
I’m doubling my stakes on this round.
[VIP 5] Are you sure about that?
You don’t even know what game it’s gonna be.
[VIP 2] It doesn’t matter what game it is, I trust my gut.
[“The Blue Danube” continues playing]
[VIP 4] Goddamn it.
Just tell us about the next game.
How long are you gonna string us along like this?
He’s in a bad mood because of 69. Better tell him quickly.
[Front Man] Gentlemen, let me introduce the next game.
[VIP 5] What’s that thing?
[VIP 1] Looks like a bridge of some sort.
[VIP 2] I like the looks of it.
What the hell is that?
[music stops]
[inhales deeply]
[woman on PA, in Korean] Welcome, players, to the fifth game.
Before we begin, please make your way down the steps and choose one of the mannequins that you see presented before you.
Once you’ve chosen, take the corresponding vest.
They are numbered 1 through 16.
Let me repeat the instructions.
Please make your way down the steps and choose one of the mannequins that you see before you, and take the corresponding vest.
They are numbered 1 through 16.
[classical music on TV]
[VIP 1, in English] Ooh, this is exciting.
Gentlemen, this may be the deciding moment.
There are plenty of other variables, but I think the order, in which they compete, matters most.
Who are you betting on this time?
Ninety-six.
What’s your reason?
Well, if I can’t do 69,
I’ll try 96.
[VIPs laughing]
[VIP 1] Good luck with that.
[VIP 2] How do you know this guy?
[VIP 1] I didn’t bring him. I thought you brought him.
[VIP 2] Me? No.
[VIP 1 laughs]
[VIP 1] Oh, jeez. You kill me.
Oh. [chuckles]
[breathing deeply]
[Gi-hun, in Korean] There are 16 people left, and there are 16 numbers.
[footsteps approaching]
[Sang-woo breathing deeply]
It was on the sixth day that God created the first man on Earth.
And now, I will go back to that day God made us sinless and innocent.
[exhales]
[sighs]
Okay. Lucky number seven, come on.
[Deok-su grunts]
[Mi-nyeo] Mm.
[classical music on TV]
[in English] They always take the middle numbers first.
Animal instinct.
When faced with danger, seek refuge in the herd.
[Gi-hun, in Korean] What should I do?
The middle numbers are all taken.
[in English] Only two choices left. Front or back?
[clicks tongue]
I can’t say I’d know which one to choose either.
[Front Man] Shall I help them along with their decision?
Sure, drop them a hint.
[VIP 4] Show mercy to the miserable!
[VIP 2] Okay, do it.
[beeps]
[woman on PA, in Korean] Your attention, please.
The numbers you see on the mannequins correspond to the order in which you will be playing.
Please make your decision carefully.
[Gi-hun] The order?
That we’re playing in?
Okay.
If this is the order we’d play, then the low numbers are better.
It’s probably gonna have a time limit like Red Light, Green Light and Honeycomb.
It’s better to get a head start.
Wait.
No.
It’d be too dangerous to go first without knowing the game.
If I stay in the back, I can watch the ones who go first and make a plan like in Tug-of-War.
[sighs]
[quirky music]
[gasps]
[Gi-hun] Sixteen.
I can’t go with 16.
Whatever it is, it’s too dangerous to go last.
[Gi-hun breathing heavily]
[panicked breathing]
Number 1? That means I’ll be starting the game off.
Then should I go last?
No, that seems wrong too.
Gi-hun, pull yourself together.
[in English] Down to two positions, first and last.
Mm. The start and the finish.
Two places you really don’t wanna be.
Going first in a life-or-death contest?
Very scary.
But recall, too, that in the first game, most of the contestants in the back died after running out of time, so… you can’t feel too comfortable picking 16 either.
You bet on 96, right?
Yeah.
Pick a good one.
What?
Where are you going?
[Player 96, in Korean] Excuse me.
[shaky breathing]
Could I be number one instead?
As long as I can remember, I’ve been hiding behind people when I got scared.
My life has been this thing that I’ve never really been able to truly control.
And I tried to act like I wasn’t afraid, but I was.
And now, as always, I’m choosing my number last after everybody else here.
I wanna get at least one last chance to claim ownership of my life.
Sir, give this chance to me.
[whimpering]
Please just give me that.
[Player 96 on TV] Thank you!
Thank you!
[VIP 4, in English] You fuckwad!
Piece of shit!
[VIPs laughing]
Oh, it’s really not your day, is it?
First, 69, and now, 96. [laughs]
[VIP 4] Motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!
Now, the game will begin.
[classical music stops]
[dark music]
Oh, wow. It’s bigger!
[VIP 1] Yeah. A lot bigger.
[suspenseful music]
[woman on PA, in Korean] Hello, players, let me welcome you all to the fifth game.
The fifth game is Glass Stepping Stones.
The stepping stones before you are made from one of two types of glass, one will be tempered glass and the other will be normal glass.
The tempered glass stepping stone as strong enough to hold the weight of two people.
However, the normal glass will break even if just one person steps on it.
For this game, you will guess which one of next two tiles is the tile made of the stronger tempered glass, and only step on those across the 18 pairs of tile.
You may then cross over to the other side safely and pass this game.
[suspenseful music continues]
That means the numbers on us…
[masked man] Are the order in which you will cross the bridge.
[whimpers]
[shaky breath]
[Player 96 shuddering]
[terrified breathing]
But then, how do I tell which is the tempered one?
[shudders]
[grunts]
[in English] Scumbag.
[slurps]
[gulps] Ah.
Bring me another scotch.
Hey, you!
I don’t wanna have to keep calling you back.
Sit down here.
I must serve the other guests, sir.
I’m gonna keep this one next to me.
Any objections?
[VIP 1] Not at all.
[VIP 2] As you please.
[VIP 1] He’s all yours.
[woman on PA, in Korean] For this game, you will have 16 minutes. Players must cross the bridge within those 16 minutes.
And now, with that, let the game begin.
Each player, take off your shoes, then go up to the tiles in order.
[tense music]
[Player 96 shuddering]
[ticking]
Hmm.
[Player 96 breathing shakily]
Hmm.
[Player 96 breathes nervously]
[man 1] What are you doing?
[man 2] We’re losing time!
[man 1] Hurry up and go!
[man 2] Just jump!
[man 3] Are you just gonna stand there?
Hey.
Take your step now or I’ll push your ass.
I’ll go. I’ll go, okay? I’ll go. I’ll go right now.
And please try to choose carefully, huh.
[breathes nervously]
[players exclaim]
[man 3] You did it.
[players chatter]
[man 4] You picked right.
Oh! Yes, that’s it. Keep doing that one after the other.
[man 4] Come on.
You got this.
That’s it. Go on.
[man 4] Come on.
[suspenseful music]
[shudders]
[glass breaks]
[players scream]
[VIP 4, in English] He’s gone.
[VIP 1] Oh, no.
[clanks]
Well, that’s it for 96.
Aw, what a shame.
Oh. Hmm, you’ve already found some more fun.
[VIP 2 chuckles]
What pretty eyes you have.
[Player 308 shuddering]
[whimpers]
[breathing heavily]
[in Korean] Step one was left.
Step two is on the right.
[Player 308 shuddering]
[tense music]
[screams]
[players gasp]
[tense music continues]
[woman 1] You can do it.
[man 1] Hey, you got this.
[man 2] Hurry the hell up and go!
I’m looking at 15.
[man 2] Stop stalling!
The tiles ahead of me.
Let’s go.
So the probability that…
[woman 1] We don’t have time for this.
I’ll get everything right is…
[man 3] Hey, you got this.
…two to the power of fifteen.
[heavy breathing]
Times that…
One in 32,768. [exhales nervously]
[laughs]
Damn it.
[shaky breathing]
[panting]
[players exclaim]
[glass shatters]
[screams]
[tense music]
[feet thudding]
[thudding continues]
[shuddering]
[whimpers]
[Player 21] Excuse me, ma’am.
Do you think that you could help me? You happen to remember what he chose next?
I can’t seem to recall which one now.
Oh, I don’t know, uh, it happened too quickly.
Think hard please.
Since both of our lives depend on getting this next one.
Okay.
The left one I think.
[man 1] Wait, no.
He went right and then he went left.
Uh, he didn’t do that.
[man 2] He went left right away.
[man 3] No, it was right from there.
[Player 21 breathing shakily]
You, are you sure… he went left first?
Mm-hm.
[breathing nervously]
[panting]
[glass shatters]
[shrieking]
[body thuds]
[gasps]
So he went right.
[glass clinks]
[VIP 1, in English] Number five fucked up.
[VIP 2] Another fall from grace.
[VIPs cheer]
Take that mask off.
[VIPs laugh]
Take your mask off!
I want to see your face.
[VIP 1] Yeah!
[VIPs cheering]
[Gi-hun, in Korean] There are ten tiles left, and 11 people still playing.
If they manage to step on one or two each, the three of us can get across to the end.
[Sang-woo] That might not be the case.
If one of those players get scared and starts to run down the time, we are in danger at the back of the line.
[ticking]
[sighs]
[eerie music]
[shaky breathing]
[gasps]
[Player 244] Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name…
Get up. What are you doing?
You’re praying right now?
[Player 244] As it is in Heaven.
Seriously?
[man 1] What’s he doing up there?
[man 2] Come on! Just go!
Hey, just get up and stop praying, okay?
You idiot, it’s your turn!
You gotta go! Everybody will die, you know!
No number can determine when the Lord calls for somebody.
Judgment is called down to us here.
It’s our time to face the Lord.
Anyway, we’re all going to Hell.
Hurry, so I can move to the next one.
If you don’t, then I might have to push you into him, okay?
[whimpers]
You want a wind-up dead, buddy? Get that asshole to stop praying.
[shuddering]
[grunts] Get going, you idiot.
Step forward. Come on, damn it! You’ll kill us all!
[glass shatters]
[man screams]
[panting]
[chuckles]
[grunts]
Thank you. God bless me today.
[shrieks]
[glass shatters]
[breathing heavily]
[gasps, shudders]
Don’t push me.
Okay?
Hey, come on. I got no reason to push you.
You gotta cross so I can. Huh?
[tense music]
[man grunts]
[breathes nervously]
[tense music]
[shaky breathing]
[tense music continues]
[tense music rising]
[Gi-hun breathes nervously]
[Sae-byeok] It’s the left.
[gasps]
It’s the left one.
Get it together.
[exhales]
[shaky breath] Okay.
[Gi-hun gasps]
[breathing heavily]
Thanks so much.
[eerie music]
[shaky breathing]
[Deok-su grunts]
You’re doing good. Now you just keep going.
[breathing nervously]
I know which one of these is the strong glass.
You mean it?
You can see the tempered glass?
I’m pretty sure. It’s in the color.
[shrieking]
[eerie music]
[breathing heavily]
You don’t know anything. Goddamn idiot.
[shaky breathing]
[clock ticking]
[feet thudding]
[breathing heavily]
[exhales]
[clock ticking]
[heavy breathing]
Hey, everybody, listen!
Anyone wanna get across?
Well, you better go first then.
Ah, shit.
[foreboding music]
[VIP 1, in English] Oh, it’s getting exciting.
We can’t show our faces in here.
You’re all mine.
But after you leave, they’ll kill me.
[VIP 4 laughs]
If you don’t do what I say, I will kill you before I leave.
[foreboding music continues]
Please.
Take me somewhere where we can be alone.
[VIP 6] You’re leaving at the most exciting moment?
Hey, you all have fun.
I’m going off for a different kind of fun.
Mmm, the real 69, huh? [purrs]
[VIP 2] Bon appétit!
[VIP 5] Have a good fucking time.
[eerie music]
[man shuddering]
[in Korean] What are you doing?
You deaf or what, asshole?
I’m not going until you do.
Are you crazy, man?
But the rule is we go in order.
[guffaws]
You can just kiss my ass.
We’re in Hell here. There’s no rules in Hell.
You wanna go so bad? Go ahead.
You scumbag!
[shuddering]
If you don’t move up, I’ll push you then.
Okay.
Well then, come on. Then do it!
We’ll all die here together!
Hey, listen, everybody!
I’m not dying here for anyone. So come on, let’s do this!
[Deok-su huffing]
Get up here and go ahead.
If you don’t, we all die.
Your choice, dickhead.
Stop that bullshit, you asshole.
The clock is ticking. You gotta go soon.
You’ll be waiting here till we’re all dead.
[guffaws]
Oh, shit.
[ticking]
[VIP 4 breathing heavily]
[moans]
[VIP 4 sighs]
[in English] That’s not the kind of face you should keep behind a mask.
[breathes heavily]
Oh. If you… can satisfy me in five minutes, I’ll change your life.
[VIP 4 moaning]
[shrieking]
[whimpers]
Satisfied?
[VIP 4 shuddering]
[grunts]
[shaky breathing]
If you can satisfy me in five minutes, I might let you live.
[breathes nervously]
Tell me everything you know about the game.
[breathes nervously]
[ticking]
[Deok-su huffing]
[man, in Korean] Damn it, you better go!
Please just go on!
[Mi-nyeo] Just go!

[exhales]
My God, you’re all such idiots.
Man, you used to act like such a tough guy.
Babe, what happened to you?
Are you really pulling the shit?
Oh, man, you’re pathetic.
You’re just an ugly old bitch, okay.
Look, I’m not moving forward. Not at all.
[laughs]
[Mi-nyeo] Deok-su.
All of these people dead but the worst thing is… I let you fuck me in the bathroom that day.
Why don’t you go first to die?
Fine. Sure.
You mean… [chuckles]
Meaning you’ll go?
Yeah.
It’s Han Mi-nyeo here.
You don’t think that I’d be able to do something quite as cowardly as… waiting here till I die.
[laughs] Come on then. Go ahead.
[breathing heavily]
[scoffs]
[Deok-su] Good luck.
[both grunting]
What are you doing?
You’re such an idiot.
Did you believe I’d really die so you could go on?
[chuckles]
Let me go.
[Mi-nyeo] Remember?
We said we’d stick together right to the end.
Crazy bitch, let me go! Damn it!
Get your fucking hands off me right now!
[both breathing heavily]
Goddamn it!
[Mi-nyeo breathing heavily]
You betrayed me. Now you’re going to die.
[tense music]
No, please.
I’ll go first, okay? Huh?
[chuckles]
Let me go, please. Please!
[Mi-nyeo] You coward.
Deok-su.
I need you to know… you’ve got such a tiny dick.
You goddamn bitch! [growls]
[Deok-su screaming]
[glass shatters]
[somber music]
[clanking]
[VIP 1] Oh.
[in English] Now there’s a poetic ending for those two.
“Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.”
Another student of the Bard. I had no idea.
Actually, it’s not Shakespeare. It’s Congreve. William Congreve.
I like you better when you don’t talk.
[sighs]
[in Korean] Go check the VIP room.
[player screams]
[VIP 1] Oh!
[laughs]
[breathing heavily]
[sighs]
[clock ticking]
Move. Quick!
You can’t just stop.
Hold on. Wait, one second. I can tell the panels apart.
You can tell?
I used to make glass for over 30 years.
You can’t normally tell, but… when you look at tempered glass when it’s lit from the side, then you can see faint stain marks.
[exhales]
[gulps]
Another hint, the sound.
Tempered glass is made at a heat over 700 degrees.
Pound on it with a hammer and it rings clearer than normal glass.
Why wasn’t all this brought up earlier?
If you had led everybody from…
[Player 17] Why would I?
The players up here tried to kill us at every chance.
[sighs]
Hmm.
[Player 17 grunts]
[feet thud]
[tense music]
[sighs]
[in English] Can he really tell the difference?
I think so.
LONG-TERM WORK EXPERIENCE IN GLASS MANUFACTURING
According to his file, he once had a job as a glass manufacturer.
That was in the report? Hah! How did I miss that?
I didn’t catch it either.
Well, that’s no fun.
[VIP 2] Yup, number 13 definitely sees something that the others can’t.
I think he might be examining the refraction of the light.
Let me adjust the settings.
[beeps]
[tense music]
[tense music continues]
It seems to have done the trick.
Yeah, he’s not so confident now.
[suspenseful music]
[Sang-woo, in Korean] What’s wrong?
What’s the problem?
[Player 17 shuddering]
I can’t tell them apart in the dark.
[Player 17 breathing nervously]
[knocking on door]
[masked man] Excuse me, sir.
[radio beeps]
[masked man] The VIP has collapsed.
[Front Man] Is he alive?
[masked man] He’s fine.
[Front Man] And the intruder?
We’re searching for him now.
[radio beeps]
[sighs]
[tense music]
[exhales]
All right, which one? You need to choose now.
[Player 17] I need to listen to the sound.
You got anything to throw?
Do… do you have anything?
[tense music]
[Player 17 sighs]
[breathes nervously]
[glass clinking]
I need another. I need to hear the right one, so I can be sure.
[Sang-woo sighs]
[thrilling music]

I can’t tell what it is.
I’ll pick, okay? [grunts]

Gi-hun’s team win their tug of war match using Player 001 and Sang-woo’s strategies, but most of them are unnerved at having to kill the opposing team. Expecting another riot, Gi-hun’s team builds a barricade, which Deok-su mocks until Gi-hun points out that Deok-su’s teammates have to turn on him sooner or later. That night Gi-hun’s teammates take turns on watch, but Deok-su’s team doesn’t attack. Jun-ho learns about the conspiracy with Player 111 for black market organ harvesting, but the conspiracy ends when the Front Man catches them. Front Man executes the remaining members of the conspiracy, including Player 111, and has a facility-wide manhunt for Jun-ho. Jun-ho breaks into the Front Man’s office and learns that the game has been running for over 30 years, and that his brother, Hwang In-ho, was the winner in 2015.

[Mi-nyeo] We’re losing! Goddamn it! Do something!
[all grunting]
Get yourselves together and listen!
Let’s try something. Take three steps up when I signal.
Up? What now? But that’s the edge!
Look, just trust me and they’ll fall!
There’s no way I’ll do that!
We might as well try!
[Mi-nyeo] No way! I can’t do it!
Move up or you’ll die!
On count of three!
One! Two!
[gasps]
Three!

Oh, Lord, protect me.
[woman] Hey, dude.
Who you think you’re praying to, huh?
To God?
[mumbling prayers]
You think you made it out of there because of God, don’t you?
[sighs]
The reason you’re still breathing and thanking that nice God of yours… is that old man there.
And that guy over there who came up with that awesome last-minute trick.
[man continues praying]
You know if there’s anybody that you should be thanking it’s them, not God.
You sad lost soul. What would you say about everybody who was nailed to the cross for our salvation today? They sacrificed themselves for us. We are here, thanks to their blood. I pray to the Lord on behalf of all us sinners. I gave thanks for their sacrifice. God made a decision to help our team win. That’s why we’re all here.
Bullshit. You killed those guys out there.
[mumbling prayers]
Oh!
If we say some prayers, do we all get to go to heaven?
I should really pray too if that’s how easy it is.
Our God who art in Heaven, we worked as a team to send people to your side. And we sent a bunch of them today. And please help us with a whole lot more to be with you. And I hope that from now on…
[Sae-byeok] Be quiet!
[man muttering prayers]
Me?
Or you mean that guy?
Everyone.
[elevator clanks]
[devices beeping]
What’s your name, huh?
Why do you care about that?
So I can use your name, duh!
It doesn’t matter.
[chuckles] So secretive.
Listen, okay.
Just leave me alone.
Well, you’re the one who asked me to join you guys.
[Player 278] Did you see that bald guy wet his pants like a little baby?
[laughs] Kids just keep blaming him how…

You know what? I really thought we were going to die out there.
And then, as soon as we’re all leaning back, I felt so powerful.
Like, “Whoa! It works. Is this real?”
Hey, old man, how do you know that?
[chuckles]
As a kid, I would always…
Oh, you copied that one thing.
From that movie. What’s it called?
The guy who dodges bullets like this.
Right?
Matrix.
Hmm.
Hey, when you got to Korea, is all you did watch movies?
And our man…
“Everybody, three steps up when I signal.” [gasps]
Oh. My God, I can’t believe how cool that was.
How did you come up with it under all that pressure?
Earlier, you were the one who said no.
Yeah? [scoffs]
Was that what you heard?
[Ali] You cried and said,
“But that’s the edge. There’s no way I’ll go.”
Like that.
Hey, you. You got a visa? I bet you don’t.
You’re an illegal alien.
[sighs] Hey, boys, how about it?
Why keep the strange foreigner when we could just ditch him?
Our team’s more secure that way, huh?
Guess I’d better do some major restructuring while I’m here.
Who’s captain here, guys?
Mr. Brains, you’ve been captain, right?
There’s no captain. We’re all equal here.
Ah! That’s great.
Building an egalitarian society!
Damn, guys.
I gotta say this is quite a change from that huge asshole who just bosses you around and pretend he’s king.
Oh, about that, grandma, why did you get kicked out?
Grandma?
Don’t you ever call me that!
Here, Han Mi-nyeo.
Got it? Mi-nyeo. That’s my name.
And I didn’t get kicked out.
I made the decision to go, all right?
Those crazy thugs there? You can’t lock me in with that crew.
[Sang-woo] They only got rid of you, then they only wound up with male players.
Right before the game at that.
You know, it’s almost like they knew about it ahead of time.
[Deok-su laughs]
[PA system chiming]
[woman on PA] Players, your bedtime will begin in 30 minutes.
Please return to your assigned beds and prepare for lights-out.
[Sang-woo] Another fight could break out like last night.
We should make a plan.
What can we do, huh?
We’ve got three girls and old man and us.
Our team is the weakest one in here.
We should choose a weak team and go after them first.
[scoffs]
For a resident priest, you sure are bloodthirsty.
I mean, everybody’s hands are bloody.
We’re all sinners, but we’re still here, aren’t we?
Attacking is our best option. So I think that’s our plan.
During the fight last night, the man in the bed in front of me got killed.
And the person he thought was on his side broke his neck.
Do you trust me then?
I don’t trust one person here.
All right.
I think let’s still do something.
Before the lights go out, let’s create a barricade.
It might be good to make sure that we have cover.
[Ali] Mm-hm.
[ticking]
[metal clanking]
[clattering]
[sniggers]
Hey, Ssangmun-dong.
[pants]
Hey, I appreciate the work you’re doing.
Nice.
But do you think these will do anything?
[scoffs] We can get through all of this easily.
[chuckles]
You’re not worried at all?
Those scumbags you got on your side over there?
They’re people you trust?
[indistinct chatter]
[metal clanking]
[man] Go. Come on.
[all laugh]
If that was me there… once the fighting starts to happen, you’ll be the first person I’d go for.
You’re the strongest person here.
[scoffs]
[metal clanking]
[clangs]
What…
[both laughing]
Boss.
So who’s our first target, huh?
Let’s take the night off.
How come?
I mean shouldn’t we try to cut down the…
Do what I tell you to do.
Oh.
Sure.
Hey.
Cut that out. We all need to rest tonight.
[Deok-su sighs]
[metal clanking]
Where’d the doc go?
He just left. He went to the restroom while you’re gone.

[Gi-hun] They’ll shut off the lights soon.
They might not all come right away.
So we better swap out who’s gonna keep watch, just to be safe, I think.
No, two of us should watch.
A pair can keep each other awake.
Just one person might go leave and betray our team.
[Sang-woo sighs]
I can… be first watch then. You don’t really sleep a lot when you’re old.
Excuse me, but are we just supposed to trust an old man like you to not sleep on the job all night?
[inhales] Let me go first.
I’m not tired yet.
I’ll go with you.
Then I’ll be next.
You wake me up the second you get tired.
Then why don’t I join you on second watch?
Assuming that’s okay with you.
Yeah, that sounds good.
[ticking]
[beeps]

[woman on PA] The work schedule is done for today.
All active staff, please return to your rooms immediately.
I repeat. Active staff, please return to your rooms immediately.
[mysterious music]
[rustling]
Have some of this.
I saved this earlier when they gave it to us for supper.
So I could give it to you.
Give it to me. What’d I do?
Today, you saved my life. It’s that simple.
[Ali] I wanted to thank you.
I’m flattered but… I just didn’t wanna die.
You gave me that money for the bus too.
I just wanted to return the favor.
Your share.
[Ali munching]
It’s Ali. Is that right?
How old are you?
Ali, yes. I’m 33, mister.
Just call me Sang-woo, okay?
You sure about that…
Sang-woo?
[chuckles]
[Ali munching]
How did you get here?
I came to Korea to make money, Sang-woo.
I don’t mean that. In here.
The game.
I needed money.
I came for that.
Got family?
Pakistan. Got my dad and mother and siblings there. I still had to take the wife and baby with me here.
You’re a father? How old is your kid?
He’s a year-old boy.
You miss them a lot?
Yes.
What’s your reason for being… in here?
The same as you. For money.

[Number 28] 29, what happened yesterday? Where were you?
[Jun-ho] Sorry.
[Number 28] “Sorry”?
I stopped the other guys from killing you because they didn’t trust you. Since you saved my life during the last dive, we’re even now. If you do that again, you’re out.

[masked man 1 scoffs] Number 29. So you’re finally here.
[Number 28] I gave him a warning.
[masked man 2] We couldn’t make the delivery last night.
We can’t let it slide with only a warning!
[Number 28] Then you can deliver this yourself.
You think it’s easy to find divers like us in this place?
[masked man 2] Make sure tonight’s delivery goes off without a hitch.
[metal door closes]
[Number 28] What? You aren’t even done with one?
[masked man 1] The doctor is slow today. More so than usual.
[Number 28] Hey, quack. Hurry it up.
This is all pointless if the boat leaves before we deliver.
You come over here and try doing this, especially when you’re sleep deprived.
I’m just barely escaping death every damn day.
[dark music]
[Number 28] That’s why we tell you what the games are beforehand and gave that extra food.
[exhales sharply]

[dark music intensifies]
[gasps, coughs]
Gi-hun.
Huh? Sang-woo.
You ready to switch?
Ah…
Okay.
[Gi-hun grunts, panting]
Are you okay?
Huh?
Looked like you were having a nightmare just now.
Oh, no, no. It’s all good.
[Deok-su] Hey.
What are you doing up?
I can’t keep my eyes shut. [sighs]
Well, you should really try to get some rest.
I’ll keep everybody safe tonight.
Glad you got our backs tonight, kid.
[man chuckles]
Heard from the doctor yet?
[man] No. This is weird. He’s taking too long.
[doctor] Hold this.
[masked man 1] We’re in a hurry. Maybe I should try working on those?
I bet I could do it if you teach me a few tricks.
Yeah. You think all of this is so simple, huh.
[masked man 2] I saw on the news doctors don’t always perform surgeries.
Sometimes it’s the office managers or nurse’s aides.
[cackles]
And some of them are better than the doctors are.
You think you know so much? Then how about you try?
[masked man 2] Who would have thought a quack who killed his own patient would still be so proud about his work?
If you were so good, how come you ruined the eyes you pulled out last time?
Those Chinese guys busted my ass!
Listen, I’ll tell you what went wrong.
That thing was still alive when I got here.
How’d you expect me to operate with all of that struggling?
[Number 28] We don’t have time for this.
The boat will be here soon.

[Player 1] Hey.
[faint screaming stops]
[Player 1 breathing heavily]
So, uh, what’s going on? Are you okay?
I thought you were sleeping with your eyes open.
[sighs] Um…
Thinking of the old days.
The old days, huh?
I worked at this place once where we went on strike.
Had a barricade just like this one.
What did you do when you were working there?
I used to make parts for cars.
Hmm. Ah.
Why did you strike?
They fired a bunch of us all at once.
[inhales deeply, sighs]
I’ve been employed there more than a decade.
I bet it wasn’t easy.
[Player 1 sighs]
[Gi-hun exhales deeply]
I had a kid on the way too.
I couldn’t afford to get fired like that.
[deep inhale]
Our bosses said we couldn’t stay. I had no other option.
[Gi-hun] They ruined the company and held us responsible.
[sighs] It made me furious.
And everyone same as now… [inhales]
…all kept watching in pairs until morning.
That way, no one could kick us all out.
[Player 1 sighs]
And we were all so scared.
Police might come any second.
I remember. I heard about it back then.
There was a huge strike. Some car company. That’s right.
I think the news turned it into this crazy story.
[Player 1] That was it. Someone died there too, right?
Mmm. [Player 1 sighs]
I’m sorry.
My goodness.
I don’t know… why I said all of that.
[Player 1] Mmm.
[somber music]
[grunts] Oh.
[groans]
[Player 1 grunts]
[groans]
Do you need help, sir?
[Player 1 moans]
What’s going on?
[grunts]
Oh.
You’re burning up.
No, no, it’s fine. I’m fine.
[masked man 1] I nearly pissed myself that night.
I thought the thing was dead, but then it shot up like a zombie.
It started glaring at me with one of its eyes popping out.
[sighs] I saw it in my dream last night.
[masked man 2] Everyone who got eliminated in Red Light, Green Light was shot by a sniper rifle.
We could hardly salvage anything.
That zombie looked promising. At least before we saw inside.
[Number 28] I almost died making the delivery that day.
But we didn’t even get full price because it only had one kidney.
It’s my fault the zombie was missing a kidney?
[Number 28] Hopefully, this guy is all right.
Most people who came here either signed away their bodies or are terminally ill.
This one better be worth it.
[Gi-hun] Here. Lie down.
[groaning]
[Gi-hun] Wait right here.
Okay. We need to lower your fever. Hold on.
[grunts]
[cloth tearing]
Ah, shit.
[Sae-byeok] Here. Use this.
[panting]
[Jun-ho] So what happened… to that zombie?
[Number 28] What do you think happened to it?
We were in a hurry, so I beat it to death with that.
[masked man 1] Hold on. Why do you need to ask?
You were there for the whole thing.
[masked man 2] What the hell?
Don’t you remember?
[Jun-ho] Back then… I was a bit out of it.
[masked man 2] You were out of it?
You got rid of the body with your own hands.
Number 29.
You haven’t been…
[doctor] This is my operating room, okay?
Stop chatting and do what I say, so I can actually do some work!
Just let me work in peace, okay? [pants]
If you don’t shut up, I’ll cut right through his liver and kidneys just like this! Damn it!
[doctor huffing]
[Player 1 breathing heavily]
Thank you, friend.
[sighs]
[clicks tongue]
Just you rest now.
After all, we can’t… start the next game without you.
[Gi-hun exhales]
[Gi-hun sighs]
You should go and rest.
I can handle this alone. [groans]
We agreed to do pairs.
And I’m already awake now.
Thanks so much.
For this.
[Sae-byeok] It wasn’t for free.
You can pay me back tomorrow.
[sighs]
[Gi-hun scoffs]
[chuckles]
[plastic rustles]
[zips]
[masked man 1] Hurry up.
[masked man 2] They’re all in great condition this time.
Make sure you get full price.
[tense music]
[Number 28] Pick up the pace. The boat’s already here.
[tense music continues]
[doctor] All right, I’m done.
What game is up next?
[masked man 1] We don’t know yet.
What’d you say?
Bullshit.
[masked man 1] We haven’t been told what it is yet.
You better go and ask your boss.
There must be somebody up there you can go ask.
[masked man 2] If he knew, he would’ve told us already.
I’m sure there’s a reason.
It sounds like that’s on you.
I did everything you said to.
Go tell them to find out this second!
[masked man 2] Go back and wait!
I’ll tell you before the next game begins.
This is a bunch of bullshit!
[eerie music]
[Number 28] What are you doing?
Pull.

[masked man 1] Calm down.
Tell me what the game is, or else I’m gonna end up getting killed tonight!
This isn’t the way to handle things. Give us more time.
I’m not giving you any more time, assholes!
[masked man 1] Then what do you suggest?
Check what’s next and come back.
[masked man 2 grunts]
[doctor] And you…
you’ll be staying right here until he returns, okay?
[masked man 1] It’ll be more dangerous if we stay here.
We have to get back before morning roll call!
I don’t care about any of that shit!
No, I’m not going anywhere until I know what it is.
[masked man 2] Fine, okay. Calm down.
Go up and find out what the game is.
[masked man 1] Okay.
[doctor breathing heavily]
[masked man 2] Wait!
You have to take the key.
The key to upstairs is in my right side pocket.
Don’t try to pull something.
[masked man 2] I’m not.
He needs it to get into the control room.
If you don’t trust me, you can throw it to him yourself.

[masked man 1 screams]

[both grunting]
[doctor panting]
[both groaning]
[Number 28] Don’t touch it.
It’s a bomb. They made this passage so the VIPs could escape in an emergency.
And once they’re all out, they set that off and blow the entire place.
[Jun-ho] The VIPs? Who are they?
[Number 28] That’s as much as I know.
[door opens]
[light switch clanks]
[Number 28] Number 29.
[knife rasps]
[hurried footsteps]
[panting]
[masked man 1] Are you there? The doctor escaped.
[keyboard clacks]
[masked supervisor] Damn it.
[doctor] Shit.
[suspenseful music]
[panting]
Shit!
[grunts]
[panting]
[doctor breathing heavily]
[Number 28] Why do you wanna know who the VIPs are?
[Jun-ho] I was just grateful for our diving equipment and this passage.
They prepared it all for us.
[Number 28] Not only are you more curious, but your voice seems to have changed.
Let me see your face.
[Jun-ho] Do you have to do this?
[Number 28] Do you wanna die?
Who are you?
[gun cocks]
[knife clanks]
Now show me yours.
Do you wanna die?
[tense music]
[doctor pants]
[door bangs]
[doctor gasps]
Stay away!
[huffing]
[masked man 1] Calm down. We can still fix this.
How will you do that?
Using that gun?
[masked man 1] Think about it.
Why would I kill you anyway?
That’ll only complicate things.
It’s complicated already.
I had to kill your friend.
[masked man 1] He wasn’t a friend.
Look, listen. I can throw bodies in the incinerator. The guy you killed, I’ll just cremate him.
It’s a huge problem when a player goes missing, but when it’s soldier, no one cares about that.
[heavy breathing]
[Jun-ho] Who I am
doesn’t matter right now, you got that?
Now, what matters is the identity of the man that you murdered here.
The one you’ve been calling a zombie.
With the one kidney, the one you put on the table who woke up.
You know where that other kidney went?
In here.
It’s in here.
He was my brother.
[trembling breath]
He gave me that kidney.
No, no, wait!
[shaky breathing]
It was a girl.
Not a man.
I’m not lying.
[masked man 1] I’ll find out what the next game is.
If you make a bigger scene and get caught, we’ll both die for nothing.
Trust me.
We still have a chance.
How can I trust someone like you, scumbag?
[doctor panting]
[exhales]
[masked man 1] Look.
Now you see, we’re all the same here.
[doctor panting]
All right.
You just need to go back quietly.
If you go back before your bedtime is up… you and I can live through this.
[metal thuds]
[doctor breathing heavily]
[doctor] Then what do I have to do?
Listen, doctor.
Let’s get you washed up before anything else.
[gunshot]
[man yelps]
I’m not lying!
It was a girl.
It sounds like bullshit.
Before we operated on her, we took turns having sex with the girl, okay?
Would we have done that to a guy?
Go check the list, if you still don’t trust me.
What list?
There’s a list of all the players with all their info as well.
Even their medical records.
Where?
[whimpers]
Over the ladderway in… the room the leader is in.
Leader?
[Number 28] You’ve seen him.
His mask isn’t the same.
[ominous music]
[chuckles]
And so, you and I will find your brother, okay?
And I’ll give you all the money I got selling organs!
Once we’re a team, we’ll be, uh…
[gunshot]
[splash]
[exhales]
[man groaning]
[Front Man] Whether you sell the dead bodies’ organs or eat them or whatever, I don’t give a damn.
However, you ruined the most important aspect of this place.
[man breathing shakily]
Equality.
Everyone is equal while they play this game.
Here, every player gets to play a fair game under the same conditions.
These people suffered from inequality and discrimination out in the world, and we’re giving them one last chance to fight fair and win.
But you broke that principle.
[grunts] Sir, I’m sorry.

He’s still here somewhere.

[Player 278] What’s going on in here? Shit.
Hey, boss, about the doctor, he’s not here.

LIST OF PLAYERS 1, 2015
[Jun-ho] Player 132…
In-ho.
[closing theme music](\^**^/)(\^**^/)Original release date: September 17, 2021
Player 111, a doctor, is given information of each game beforehand, and is working with a handful of staff to harvest organs from the dead players. He joins Deok-su’s team by offering game info. Gi-hun realizes that Sang-woo could have helped their team in the previous game. The staff ferment discord among the players and Deok-su kills another player, which only results in the prize money being increased. After lights out, a riot erupts and numerous players are killed. Player 067 joins Gi-hun’s team, who protect her from Deok-su’s gang. When Player 001 begs everyone to stop, the Front Man has the soldiers end the riot. Gi-hun’s team exchange names: Player 199 is Ali Abdul, and Player 067 is Kang Sae-byeok. Player 001, who has a brain tumour, says he remembers his name, but is unable to reveal it due to his worsening condition. In the third game, players are told to form groups of ten. Deok-su, knowing that the upcoming game is tug of war, picks strong men and rejects Player 212, Han Mi-nyeo, who has to join Gi-hun’s team of weaker players.

[Deok-su] Thank you.
[Sang-woo] Gi-hun, wait.
Huh?
Nothing.
You saved me. [panting]
What?
[panting]
You’re the reason I got through this round.
[both chuckle]
Sirs, you made it!
Oh.
[breathing deeply]
[Ali sighs] I’m glad you made it.
I was really worried.
It will take a whole lot more killing Gi-hun. Hah!
I got Ssangmun-dong running through this heart, huh?
[Player 1 chuckles]
Are you holding up all right here, mister?
I’m okay. Yes.
All thanks to your sharp thinking.
[Player 1 and Gi-hun chuckle]
[Sang-woo] I’m sorry.
I was wrong to suggest separating.
Ah, don’t say that.
How could you know what it was?
Choosing the umbrella was my call.
Don’t worry, okay?
Mm.
Yeah, the whole team made it.

This is all we get?
Asshole.
[sighs]
I came just close to dying. And what do I get for all of that? An egg for a meal.
[scoffs]
[not audible dialogue]
[Deok-su scoffs]
Are they kidding us with this shit?
Hey. Sorry, I’m coming through.
Coming through.
Excuse me. Thank you.
Excuse me.
Hey, miss, what are you doing, huh?
Shut your mouth and grab an egg.
[elevator bell dings]
[elevator door closes]
Uh, I didn’t get anything.
Where’s the rest?
Hey, we didn’t get our meals either.
One, two, three, four, five.
Five meals are missing, sir.
[masked supervisor] We prepared food for the exact number of players.
Then where is ours?
Please, sir, we need to eat! [exclaims]
It was prepared for the exact number.
[woman] Excuse me.
It was them. They… skip the line and got seconds. I saw it.
Hey, what’s the matter, everybody? Jeez.
You never see a guy eat before, is that it?
Shit. [Deok-su chuckles]
[panting]
[Player 271] Who do you think you are?
That’s my food you just ate.
Ah. So, uh, is this yours?
Is your name on it?
‘Cause I sure don’t see anything.
[all laugh]
I’m sorry. [scoffs]
Give me that.
[Player 271 grunting] Give it back. It’s mine.
Give it back to me!
[Deok-su grunts]
[bottle shatters]
You little shit, goddamn it.
Why did you break it, you jerk? How was this, huh?
[Player 271 grunts]
[players exclaim]
How come a scrawny guy like you is so greedy about food?
You piece of shit!
[grunting]
Hey, listen up. You should learn to share.
Is it too hard, you dumbass?
[Deok-su] You bastard! What the hell? You shithead.
[Player 271 groaning]
[Deok-su] Shit.
[Player 271 groaning]
[tense music]
[huffing]
[Sang-woo] Hey, you okay? Hey, wake up.
He’s gone.
[players murmuring]
Uh, hello, guards.
Can someone do something?
[shaky breathing]
Hey, didn’t you hear that?
A person died.
That man there just died.
Look, that man was killed.
That bastard… That bastard just killed him.
[panting]
He just killed someone over there!
He just died!
Can’t you hear me, huh?
Help us now!
A man just died!
[Gi-hun] We shouldn’t be killing each other like this!

Please return to the quarters now.

We can’t fall asleep tonight, okay?
Who knows what someone else may try.
[Sang-woo] Look at them. It looks like they’re planning something.
If they try to attack someone, let’s group together and fight them.
Come to our side if anything goes wrong.
Okay, I will.
[indistinct chatter]
Sir, wake up.
[grumbling]
Wake up, sir.
[moans]
Sorry, but you really can’t go to sleep after lights-out, understand?
Why?
We gotta keep an eye out. It will be dangerous.
And we’ll come here if anything goes down.
Uh. Okay.
[background chatter]
[Gi-hun] Hey, pickpocket.
[sighs]
Are you okay?
It looked like you and that thug really had it out for each other.
So what?
Tonight, if anything happens, we’ll all meet in my bed right there.
Are you in?
I don’t trust people.
And that’s twice as true for anyone who’d end up in here. Got it?
You think that’s how it works, huh?
Listen, you don’t trust people here because you can.
You do it because you don’t have anybody else.

[masked man 1] Was there an accident?
[Number 28] I don’t know.
[masked man 2] Then you’ll need to deliver this alone.
[Number 28] I can’t go underwater by myself. It’s too dangerous.
Enough! Tell me now.
The next game, what is it?
[suspenseful music]
[exhales]
Are you sure?
If I get eliminated, then I can’t do all of this.
[masked man 1] Worry about that after you survive the night.
What’s tonight?
[masked man 1] Fighting will break out.
We gave you less food on purpose to make you all fight each other.
Weeding out the weaklings before the next game begins.
It’s all part of the game.
[masked man 2] You know we can’t protect you when you’re in there.
Go back to the players and find a way to live.
Way to live?
[masked man 1] Stick with the strongest.
That’s the only way you’ll live.
[eggshell cracks]

[all murmur]

[Player 111] You’re a strong team.
Let me join.
[Deok-su scoffs]
Why should we?
Tell us, what are you good at?
I’m a doctor out there.
You might need me.
So?
You’re gonna come give me a shot if I get sick?
[all chuckling]
Go sit somewhere in the corner, come lights-out.
Don’t breathe or make a noise. [sighs]
If I hear you breathe… then I’ll come for you.
[ominous music]
[softly] I know what the next game is.

I’m… I… I’m scared.
We are all gonna die in here!
Everyone, every single one of us is going to die!
Please. I’m so scared.
Stop this madness!

Huh?
All of the… That was dangerous. When did you get up there?
We were worried about you, sir, when you disappeared.
Nobody here got hurt so that’s good.
[Player 1 exhales]
Uh, well, at this point, we should know what to call each other.
Why don’t we go around and tell each other our names now.
I know your name already, though.
Ssangmun-dong.
[chuckles]
Ssangmun-dong is just my hometown.
The name is Seong Gi-hun.
Seong Gi-hun of Ssangmun-dong.
So then, what about your name?
Ali.
Ali Abdul.
And where are you from?
Pakistan.
Pakistan?
Where is that?
North of India.
[Ali] He’s right.
Of course, he is. This man here went to SNU…
Cho Sang-woo.
[Gi-hun chuckles]
Come on, really?
[clicks tongue]
We’re all teammates here now.
We should really know about each other, build up a little trust, okay?
Kang Sae-byeok.
Sae-byeok?
That’s a pretty name.
Though I’m not sure how well it fits.
And what is your name, sir? If you don’t mind.
What?
My name?
Oh.
[Player 1] It…
[Player 1 grunts]
Uh…
Let me think.
[grunts]
Hold on, it…
So…
It…
They call me…
[clears throat, chuckles] It’s okay.
Hey, old man, you must be really shook up today.
You know when I’m stressed, my home address slips right out of my head.
Along with my social security. [chuckles]
[Gi-hun] It’ll be okay once you get some rest.
[Deok-su grunting]
[shaky breathing]
[groans]
Damn it.
That hurts. Doctor, my ass.
I’m almost done here.
Thankfully, it didn’t go in too far. You’ll be fine.
Outside, I’ll be able to treat it at the hospital, okay?
[Player 212] Pretentious dickhead.
You must have lost your practice to be in this place.
I will get out of here.
With that money.
[scoffs]
[man] Those bastards.
Why they make it so we could kill other players and then end it like this?
Games will be over.
We could’ve ended this whole thing right there and then.
If we kill everyone else, what happens to us?
And won’t we get to… take all that money?
We’ll be able to try and kill them again as long as we don’t die.
Right, Doc? In the next game.
[Deok-su chuckles]
[doctor] All done.
I guess this is why everyone says you really should have a doctor in your family.
[Deok-su laughs]
[Player 212] We got rid of quite a few.
Players down from 107 to 80, that means we killed 27?
Right, old man?
“Old man”? [chuckles]
You’re gonna call me that? [scoffs]
[Deok-su] You seem way older than me.
Oh, yeah?
Tell me how old do I look?
Forty-nine.
Oh, please. I guess I shouldn’t have lent you that lighter then, huh?
Thirty-nine?
Old man, one more chance.
Uh…
Nineteen?
Bingo.
You’re a quick learner.
But what’s my… reward for guessing?
I’ll go think about it in the restroom, okay?
[breathing heavily]
I’m going to the bathroom too.
[Deok-su grunts]
[Deok-su and Player 212 moaning]
[moaning continues]
[both breathing heavily]
[both panting]
Old man.
You and that doctor are hiding something.
There’s nothing to hide. [sighs]
[puffs]
Old man.
Do you… swear to stick together right to the end?
Just tell me that you will.
[Deok-su chuckles]
Okay. I promise you.
Together, you and I will get out of here.
What’s your name, old man?
Why?
I just wanna know it.
[sighs]
Deok-su.
Jang Deok-su.
[huffs]
Deok-su.
You betray me…
I’ll kill you, okay?
You’re the reason that I think… I might die tonight.

Huh?
Did you stay up all night?
[Player 1 chuckles]
I thought they would attack again or something.
Old man, but you must be so exhausted already.
[sighs] It’s all right. You don’t really need that much sleep when you’re old. And I didn’t help when they went after everyone but keeping night watch, well, I can do that.

We need to get a bunch of men who are well built.
Oh, okay.
What about the girl?
[clock ticking]
Something that has teams of ten players.
So maybe it’s Tail Tag or Why Did You Come to My House?
[sighs]
Tail Tag means running is involved.
Or it might just end up being simply based on luck.
What do you think?
[deep inhale]
Our team already has a girl and an older guy.
I’m thinking we better get more men first.
What if they make us play Gonggi or Elastics? Then, what do we do?
Girls are usually the good ones at that…
That’s true, but when it really comes down to it, usually men are better.
It’s our lives we’re betting on right now.
And we gotta win.
[inhales]
[exhales]
Five more people are needed.
I see that we each bring one guy to join us.
[Sang-woo] Okay?
[Player 1 grunting]
Don’t let them see.
You’ll seem weaker.
[players chattering]
[man 1] Boss, excuse me. Look, this guy wants to join us.
Hey, go find more guys.
[Gi-hun sighs]
[indistinct chatter]
[sighs]
Sir?
Got a team yet? Are you taken?
Huh? Uh, no.
Come join ours then, sir. We have a team.
Well, the thing is, though, so I can’t join unless she does, too. [nervous chuckle]
Would you let her?
Oh, I’m sorry.
Our team already has too many girls.
Excuse me. Still picking who to join in? You should come with us.
Excuse me, sir.
If you’re not on a team yet, perhaps you would like to join ours?
[Deok-su] Let’s team up next time.
[Player 212] Babe, wait!
I don’t get it. Come on, you’re just joking.
My team is full. I’m sorry.
We’ve got ten already.
[chuckles] Old man. No, please, you can’t do this.
[sobs] I’m sorry.
I’ll do anything.
Babe, I swear I’ll do better.
Uh, I’m good at everything. You know that’s true.
Just listen, okay?
Let’s split up just for this game, all right?
Then meet up with the next one, huh?
[sobs] But… do we really need to, though?
You said we’d do this together.
Babe.
Can you really do this alone?
I need you, old man. Can’t you see that?
Get off!
[whimpers]
God, this bitch is so pathetic. Get your hands off me.
And stop calling me “babe” and “old man,” huh!
Call me that one more fucking time, and I’ll cut your goddamn throat out!
[shaky breathing]
You asshole.
Just stop it. You were using me.
Jang Deok-su.
Goddamn you, scumbag.
[scoffs]
You betrayed me, you’re dead now. Got that?
Oh, I’m so scared…
Ms. Han Mi-nyeo.
Well then, best of luck to you, huh?
[men laugh]
[man] She’s not worth it anyways.
What do you want?
Play with us.
[indistinct chatter]
[Gi-hun] One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine? Um…
Wait, did someone not bring anyone?
[sighs deeply]
It was me. I didn’t.
What about you? Who brought you here?
Her.
I said to bring only men back here, didn’t I?
This doesn’t sound good.
You want me to go?
I’ll go now.
No, wait. Hold on.
It’s okay. Stay where you are.
We don’t even know what we’re doing yet.
And the time’s almost over.
At this point, let’s just find one more team and be done.
We put together a weak team, who would want to join it?
That means that once the timer’s done, we’ll end up with anyone that got kicked out.
Well, nobody kicked me out, huh!
I’ll play with you as a special deal here, okay?
Man, you guys lucked out today. Yikes!
I’ll be way more help than either of these wimpy little girls.
Plus, I’m good at everything except the things that I can’t do.
[Mi-nyeo laughs]
[sighs]
[clock beeps]
[woman on PA] The time for forming your teams is over.
All players, please line up with your teammates at the entrance to the game hall.
Hold on.
We’re not gonna stay in here, though?

[masked manager] I would now like to welcome you all to the third game.
Today’s game is Tug-of-War.
In order to win, you must pull the rope towards your platform in an attempt to drop your opponents down below.
[sighs]
Now, I will draw numbers to decide which two teams will play first.
Everyone, please sit down.
[players murmuring]
[masked manager] First, the team that will play on the left tower.
Team One. Team One, please stand up.
And now, the team that will play on the right tower.
Team Seven.
Team Seven, please stand up.
[shaky breath]
[masked manager] Teams One and Seven will be the first teams to play.
Will both teams please go to your towers.
[foreboding music]

Get them!

Oh! Oh, shit!
[players screaming]
[player] Shit!
[screaming, grunting]
Get them!
[players screaming]

[all exclaim]
[gasps]
[blade screeching]
[all scream]
[panting, laughing]
[Deok-su laughs]
[players panting]
[ominous music]
[woman on PA] The following players, Player 245, Player 120, Player 37, Player 408, Player 27, Player 273, Player 58, Player 243, Player 327, and Player 241 are eliminated.
[man grunting]
[moaning]
[player groaning]
[eerie music]
[masked manager] I will now draw the teams for the next round.
Team Four.
Team Five.
[whispers] Damn it.
All men.
Team Four and Team Five, please go to your towers.
[Sang-woo breathing heavily]
[Deok-su chuckles]
Oh, man. I was looking forward to killing you guys.
[tense music]
[beeping]
[tense music continues]
[rumbles]
[Player 1 grunts]
Come on. Don’t lose your spirit.
Tug-of-War needs more than just raw strength.
Well then, what it’s about, huh? We just go out and speak to them?
All you need is a good strategy in Tug-of-War and combined with good teamwork, you’ll be able to win when you are against stronger teams.
Only one thing can help us now.
It’s the Lord himself, I know it.
[scoffs]
You can barely stay standing, old man.
So shut up and keep all your strength, okay?
[clears throat]
Wait a minute, let’s hear what the old man says.
[panting]
Okay, when I was young, we always like Tug-of-War. It’s a game I know well. And back then, I would always win, even if there was a wrestler on the other team, and it seemed the odds were stuck against us.
[Player 1] Listen closely, and I’ll tell you how my team and I were able to win even when it seemed impossible.
First off, having a good leader is very important.
The person is at the front and keeps an eye on how the other team is performing.
And the rest of the team focuses on the back of their leader’s head and follows their lead.
If the leader seems weak or looks like their spirit is beginning to falter, then the game is already over.
And then at the end of the rope, you’ll need to have someone strong and dependable like the anchor of a ship.
After that, it’s all about how you arrange the rest of your team.
If one player is on the right side of the rope, then the next one should be on the left, all the way down the rope.
Both of your feet should be facing straight forward, and then, hold the rope in your armpits.
That way, everyone can put in all of their strength.
Finally, and this is absolutely the most important thing. Once the game begins, for the first ten seconds…
[all scream]
…you have to hold your ground.
You should lean back, practically lie down.
Push your lower abdomen up to the sky, as hard as you can.
And throw your head back to the point where you can almost see the groin of the person behind you.
If you do that, the other team won’t be able to pull us to their side.
Just hold like this for ten seconds.
Then the opposing team will start to get frustrated because they are thinking, “Why won’t they budge?”
Because they believed that they were much stronger.
If you can hold out for that long, you will be able to catch a moment in your opponents’ hold, and their rhythm breaks.
Now’s our chance!
[Team Four rhythmic shouting]
[all grunting, shouting]
[rhythmic shouting continues]
[Team Five grunting]
Pull it together!
[all grunting]
[rhythmic shouting]
[rhythmic shouting continues]
[Mi-nyeo exclaims]
[Team Four grunting]
[Mi-nyeo yells]
We’re losing! Goddamn it! Do something!
[Team Four grunting]
Get yourselves together and listen! Let’s try something. Take three steps up when I signal.
Up? What now? But that’s the edge!
Look, just trust me and they’ll fall!
There’s no way I’ll do that!
We might as well try!
[Mi-nyeo] No way! I can’t do it!
Move up or you’ll die!
On count of three!
One! Two!
[gasps]
Three!
[screams]
[closing theme music](\^**^/)(\^**^/)Original release date: September 17, 2021
Jun-ho hides among the masked staff as they travel to the game’s island location. After waking up in the dorms, the players are more prepared and start forming alliances. Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Player 001 and Player 199 team up, and note that most players returned, including Player 212, who was the first to beg to leave. Player 067 sneaks into the vents and observes staff workers in a kitchen. In the second game, the players are to pick a stamped shape out of a sugar honeycomb snack. Sang-woo identifies the game quickly, using information from Player 067, but doesn’t warn his teammates and picks the simplest shape for himself. Gi-hun completes the game despite having the highest difficulty shape. Player 212 helps Deok-su complete the game and is accepted in his team.

I just got seasick.

You do not speak unless your superior allows you to.

[foreboding music continues]
[Gi-hun] Hey, sir.
[soft gasp]
[Gi-hun] Wake up, sir.
[soft classical music playing on speakers]
Wake up. Get up, huh?
[Player 1] Uh-huh.
[sighs]
[Gi-hun] Are you all right?
You’re here.
[gasps]
So Player 456 came back.
Yeah.
I got scared. I thought you were gone for good.
[chuckles]
Hey. I won’t die so easily, you know.
I know you won’t.
[Player 1 chuckles]
I stopped playing because of you, and I’m back because of what you said.
I’m actually sort of partial to you.
[chuckles]
[classical music playing]
[background chatter]
[Player 1] A lot of people decided to come back.
[sighs] You’re right. Hmm.
Yeah.
I guess everybody’s desperate.
Oh.
Huh?
There, look. That’s the woman who couldn’t name her kid. She came back too.
[Player 1] You’re right.
Think she named her kid yet?
I don’t know.
[Sang-woo] Gi-hun.
Oh, Sang-woo.
So you’re here. I didn’t think I’d see you.
[clicks tongue]
Neither did I. [awkward chuckle]
And you?
Your mom, did you see her?
[Ali] Hey, good sirs.
[Gi-hun] Oh. Hey.
It’s my angel.
I’m happy to see both of you. I hope we make it.
[Gi-hun sighs]
Thanks for the bus fare, sir. It meant so much to me.
What, you gave him the bus fare?
Because he said that he’d walk Yeouido to Ansan.
[chuckles] That’s so heartwarming.
We’re like a bunch of soldiers at training camp, huh?
[Gi-hun laughs]
A training camp is what?
You know, it’s like the army shooting guns.
Oh! Soldiers all training together?
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute.
Since we’re on the subject now, you should join me.
We should just form our own team, don’t you think?
You’re right. Who knows what game they’ll have us play next.
It wouldn’t hurt to be in a group so we’re ready for anything.
Hey, you should join up with us.
I mean, we already know he’s crazy strong.
You saw it.
He lifted me up with one hand like it was nothing at all.
You mean… that you… I can join you?
Oh, yeah, sure. Uh, so then, you’ll be the new recruit.
He’s the skilled corporal, and that means I’m a sergeant.
Oh, man. Thank you, sir. [chuckles]
Please just drop the “sir,” will you?
[Player 1] Excuse me.
If you don’t mind, can I join up with all of you?
Yeah, of course.
And you can be the… Hold on…
So you can be the old major who’s been in the army his entire life.
Thanks so much.
[both laugh]
Yeah. Quite a team we got going here. Damn! Let’s do this.
[chuckles]
I’ll take you in again and look past everything.
Come and join us.
We were a good team for a while out there, huh?
Are you actually serious?
I mean, everybody out there is still looking for you.
Stop with the act.
It doesn’t matter how tough you are,
you’re not going to win in this place. Not on your own.
Didn’t you notice? [chuckles]
Those jerks with masks came in
and removed the beds of the people who died.
Make one mistake out there, and yours is next.
[chuckles]
Worry about your own ass, okay?
[men laugh]
[Deok-su sighs]
[Player 67] Don’t join him.
This guy’s a dumb dumbass.
He liked to pick all of his little minions’ pockets
just so he could fill up his own.
He got bold enough one day to go after his head honcho’s pockets,
but now he’s in here.
‘Cause he was stupid and got caught.
You know what people in my hometown would call you, huh?
A damn revolutionary asshole.
[men laugh]
You communist little bitch, I’m gonna…
[grunts] Excuse me.
Am I interrupting you?
Sorry.
What is it?
Oh, boy.
You’re really good looking.
[chuckles]
[scoffs]
Come on, let me join you guys.
Join what?
I’ll be your teammate.
[men chuckle]
Tell me what you’re good at?
Everything, except the things I can’t do.
And I’m certainly better than some skinny girl.
A lot better.
[men exclaim]
You mean, you’re that good?
How about it?
Plenty of empty beds.

[Front Man] Keep an eye on the ones who didn’t return to play
and keep me posted.
[masked manager] Yes, sir.
[receding footsteps]
[indistinct chatter]
[Gi-hun] Mm…
Ahh…
This brings back old memories.
Do you remember eating lunches like this too?
Of course.
My wife was always in the kitchen every morning.
She’d pack lunches just like these ones for me and my kids.
[chuckles]
I wish the rice was piping hot.
At least they could’ve warmed it up a little.
[grumbles] All we need is a stove.
Remember doing that?
The little briquette stove we had in our elementary school classroom.
We’d stick our lunch boxes on it.
It’d get burning hot on us too,
and the rice’d get all scorched. Hmm?
Gi-hun.
Hmm?
Let’s try to stay on the subject.
How about putting your mind to what the game could be?
[Player 1] Mm.
Hey.
No one can figure that out.
We’ll find out when it’s time.
You know, considering the last one that we did,
I think that there’ll be another old game kids played, just like I used to.
I’ll bet you right there.
Think of all the ones they could choose.
Ddakji, Dabanggu,
there’s Hopscotch, Biseokchigi,
and Tag, Don Katsu, Freeze Tag.
And for girls, there’s Gonggi, Elastics, Cat’s Cradle and…
And what else?
I don’t know how to play those.
You don’t know any of the games I listed?
Hey, listen to me.
All those games are easy to learn.
And we’ll teach them to you.
[chuckles]
That’s much appreciated.

[Player 212] Hey, hey, hey! Open the door, you jerks!
I have to pee really bad, right now!
Don’t you jerks ever take a leak?
Let me use the restroom! I gotta go now!
Hey, just let me use the bathroom for one second. Jeez, come on!
Look, it’s mostly men in here, okay? Want a puddle here?
Damn it! Damn you, scumbags!
I hope you’re ashamed.
Treat us like humans, damn it! Who do you think you are?
Hey, Triangle.
I don’t need you. Get me your superior.
Just get me that some square head guy!
[masked supervisor] You may not leave this room past your given curfew.
Damn it. You masked guys think you control when I’m supposed to pee, huh?
[thuds]
Oh, what the…
You freaking bastards! [banging]
You don’t think I’ll go pee right here and now?
Shit!
[sighs] Here I go.
You all ready to hear some rain?
[door opens]
[masked man] Follow me.
Damn, Koreans won’t listen to someone until they start screaming at you.
Goddamn it.
I gotta go.
Oh, yeah? [scoffs]
I beg to get the damn toilet,
and you’re gonna sit right on top of it like that?
Hey.
You’re a pretty annoying girl, aren’t you?

Why won’t it come out?

[knocks on door]
[masked man] It’s time to go back.
Just give me a second, okay? [breathes heavily]
Come on, you. Oh, it’s all blocked.
You bastard, get out!
Hurry the hell up! We’re in a rush, okay?
[masked man] You need to go back.
Come out now.
Wait! Stop! No! Wait!
They’re gone. All of the stool wipes are gone!
Ah, shit.
[water running]
Yeah, but I’ll use the sink.
No, don’t come in.
You just stay out there.
Did you hear that?
Don’t come in here. I’m not wearing pants, okay?
Okay.
[groans] The water is still nice in here.
[rat squeaking]

[masked supervisor] What?

[knocks on door]
[masked man] You have to come out.
[Player 212] Damn it! There’s no toilet paper here either!
If you don’t, I’ll drag you out.
[Player 212] I have to wipe myself, okay!
Hey, aren’t you supposed to check each stall for toilet paper?
Get that square guy here!
I need to file a complaint.
You bastard, what the hell?
[Player 212] I can’t believe this.
[Player 212 huffing]
[toilet flushes]
You little bastard! You…
Hey, jerkface.
You, I said don’t come in, didn’t I?
You harassed us in there, yeah?
Hey, the second I’m out of here, I’ll sue your ass, okay?
Is that clear? Asshole!

You must have seen something. You were up there for so long. Come on.

All players, please form a line in the center of the room.
[Player 212] Hey.
What did you see? Tell me now.
It’s the morning now, you said you would.
You were in there for a while, so go on.
Masked guys with pots, and they were melting a liquid down there.
What was it?
I couldn’t tell what.
Goddamn it!
I had to put on that whole show just to save your life back there,
and you couldn’t tell?
I smelled it, though.
What did it smell like?
Sugar or something.
You kidding me?
Are you saying they were melting sugar in there?
I think they were.
So, it was just that?
[sighs]
Girl.
Look, if you aren’t telling me everything. I’ll burn your eyes out with cigarettes.
[exhales]
I guess I’m hungry.
I’m craving something sweet.
[Player 212] Goddamn it.
Maybe they’ll give us candied sweet potatoes today.

Hey, is there…
any chocolate milk? I can’t drink the normal kind.
Oh, when I was a kid, I had problems digesting it,
so I just skipped milk when I was in school.
[Player 1 laughs]
Ah, shit.
My goodness.
As a kid, I’m willing to bet you got spanked a lot.
How did you know?
My son did too. He was just like you, friend.
[laughs]
[background chatter]
[Ali] Hey, sir.
Why aren’t you eating that?
[plastic rustles]
Have it.
Do you mean it?
I don’t eat most mornings.
Thanks so much, sir.
You know, geniuses never eat much.
[Sang-woo sighs]
Take mine too.
Thank you, sir.
[chuckles]
[classical music plays on speakers]
[woman on PA] Attention. The second game will begin shortly.
Please follow the staff’s instructions
and swiftly make your way towards the game hall.
I will now repeat the instructions.

[tense music continues]
[vehicle beeping]
You saw something, right?
I happen to overhear your discussion last night.
So tell me, what did you see?
Why would I?
You’re a defector, right?
All the games they made us play in here are games I have known
since I was a young boy.
The next game will be too, I’m willing to bet.
You tell me what you saw,
I might guess what it is.
[drum beating]
[playful music]
[playful music continues]
Why the hell is this playground so huge?
What’s the game here?
[woman on PA] Players, welcome to the second game.
We will begin shortly.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey, what do we think? Huh?
Maybe that roundabout there.
Jungle gym without falling?
Huh?
[woman on PA] Players, before the second game begins,
choose one of the four available shapes you see on the wall.
Once you’ve chosen your shape, please stand in front of it.
Does she mean those?
So our options are circle, triangle,
star, umbrella.
I don’t know. They seem very familiar.
[Sang-woo] You tell me what you saw, I might guess what it is.
They were heating sugar.
[suspenseful music]
[gasps]
[Gi-hun] Sang-woo.
Huh?
Got anything?
Not yet.
[woman on PA] Choose a shape and stand in front of it immediately.
Choose a shape and stand in front of it immediately.
[indistinct chatter]
[murmurs] What do you think it could be?
Should we play this together?
That could be dangerous.
At this point, we don’t know anything.
I think it would put us at a disadvantage if we just choose one.
You think?
There’s this saying in investing.
“Try not to keep your eggs in the same basket.”
[chuckles]
Listen to him.
He was first in his class in SNU Business School.
And in my hometown, he was a genius. A prodigy.
Really? Is that so?
Well then, he is an incredible guy, huh?
Are you kidding me?
[both chuckle]
Like Sang-woo told us, let’s all split up and take it from there, huh?
[Gi-hun] Who should go where?
[indistinct chatter]
All right, let me go triangle.
What about you?
Dayira.
[Gi-hun] Huh?
Dayira.
A circle, you mean?
Yeah.
It looks just like the moon where I’m from.
[Gi-hun sighs, clicks tongue]
That means we have star and umbrella.
[Player 1 sighs]
You pick first. Go on.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Uh, then I’m choosing the umbrella.
[Sang-woo] Hmm?
You sure?
Why?
Oh, growing up, I’d always lose my umbrella so my mom would get angry.
So then, she gave me broken ones to bring to school.
I always wanted her to get me one of those good umbrellas
like the other kids.
Mm-hm.
Um, don’t want the star? Or do you wanna switch with me?
Oh, no, the star sounds great. [clears throat]
Good with me.
Besides, nobody really sees many stars these days.
Great, let’s get moving.
Once we know what we’re up against, let’s set up a strategy together.
[Player 1] Sure.
All right.
[Player 1] Hmm.
Gi-hun, wait.
Huh?
[inhales sharply]
[exhales]
Nothing.
[chuckles]
[indistinct chatter]
[woman on PA] The time to select your shape has ended.
I will now explain the rules of the next game.
[doors thud]
All players, please take one case each from the table at the front of your line.
All players, please take one case each from the table at the front of your line.

Please take a moment to open the case and check the contents.
HONEYCOMB
[tense music]
[grunts]
[metal clanks]
What does this mean?
[sighs]
[woman on PA] The second game is sugar honeycombs.
The shape you have chosen
is the shape you must remove from the honeycomb.
[Gi-hun] I’m dead.
[woman on PA] The time limit is ten minutes.
You will pass if you trim out the shape without it breaking or cracking
within the time limit.
With that, let the game begin.

[closing theme music](\^**^/)(\^**^/)Original release date: September 17, 2021
More than half the players were killed in the first game, and some survivors beg to leave. According to the third clause of the game’s agreement, if the majority agree to end the games, all players will be sent home. The players vote, and Player 001’s deciding vote has all of them sent home safely. Upon returning, Gi-hun goes to the police but no one believes his story except Detective Hwang Jun-ho, whose missing brother received the same card as Gi-hun. The game staff give the players the chance to resume playing, and many return, including: Gi-hun, whose mother needs a medical procedure; Sang-woo, who’s about to be arrested for financial fraud; Player 001, who feels he has nothing to live for; Player 067, who wants to smuggle her parents out of North Korea; Player 199, who attacked his employer for withholding wages; and Player 101, a gangster on the run. Jun-Ho secretly follows Gi-hun when he’s picked up by the game staff.

You saved my life out there.
You’re alive. That is what matters.
[alarm buzzing]
[door clanking]
[masked manager] You have all made it through the first game.
Congratulations.
You’re moving on.
[sighs]
I will now announce the results of the first game.
[beeps]
[digital trilling]
[beeps]
[sighs]
[masked manager] Out of 456 players, 255 were eliminated, and 201 players successfully completed the first game.
[players gasp, murmur]
[breathing heavily]
[sighs]
[woman 1] Mister, please.
[sobs] Listen. I’m so sorry.
I swear I will pay what I owe.
I’ll do it, I’ll pay it all. [crying]
Please, sir. [sobs]
I have a child.
Oh! So young,
I need to register, and I still need to name my child, sir.
[cries]
[woman 1] Please, sir, let me leave.
[woman 2] Please. I’m so sorry.
Sir, I’m begging you. Let me leave and I swear
I’ll find a way to pay it all.
Let me go home.
[woman 3] Me too.
I can’t keep going. Sir, please, I can’t go on.
[players clamor]
[man 1] Please let me go home.
[masked manager] There seems to be a misunderstanding.
We are not trying to hurt you or collect your debts.
Let me remind you that we’re here to give you a chance.
[man 2] A chance?
We play some kids games.
And you shoot us. You want me to choose that?
That’s some chance.
We may be in debt, sir… [cries]
…but that doesn’t justify killing us all.
[masked manager] This is just a game.
[all murmur]
Killing everyone out there was a…
game to you, huh?
They were simply eliminated for breaking the rules of the game.
If you just follow the rules,
you can leave this place safely with the prize money we promised.
Just keep your damn money. I don’t care!
Let me just go home. That’s all I want.
[indistinct chatter]
[man 3] Let us leave. Let us go.
[masked manager] Consent form clause 1.
A player is not allowed to stop playing.
Come on! You think you’ll get away with this, huh?
[Player 119] The police will come.
They’ll bust in here any minute now. They’ll be here since we all disappeared.
Yeah.
And I bet they have everybody’s phones tracked here already.
Look at all your hostages. You’re doomed if you don’t let us go!
We’re all dead!
[gunshot]
[players exclaim]
[cocking]
Consent form clause 2.
A player who refuses to play will be eliminated.
[Sang-woo] Consent form clause 3.
If all the players agreed to stop playing,
the games are allowed to end.
Or am I wrong?
[masked manager] You are correct.
So let’s vote on ending this.
If the majority wishes to leave this place,
then everyone gets to go home, right?
All right, as you wish.
We will take a vote to decide on the termination of the game.
[players muttering]
Before we vote,
let me announce the prize money for the game as previously promised.

[masked manager] A total of 255 players were eliminated during the first game.
A hundred million won is at stake per player.
Therefore, 25.5 billion won of prize money has been accumulated so far.
If you wish to give up on playing, the 25.5 billion won
will be sent to the bereaved families of the late players,
100 million won each.
However, you will all return home empty-handed.
Uh, sir…
So then, if we can complete all six games,
how much do we get?
[masked manager] Since there were 456 players,
the total prize money is 45.6 billion won.
And with that, we will now begin the voting.
As you can see, there are two buttons in front of you.
If you wish to continue playing, press the green button with an O.
If you wish to stop playing,
then please press the red button with the X instead.
After you finish voting,
move to the other side of the white line and wait.
Voting will be done in reverse order of the numbers on your chests.
Player 456, please cast your vote.

[Player 119] Have you all gone crazy?
We have to leave.
We can’t keep putting up with this insanity.
[Player 212] So what if we leave?
Tell me, what changes?
Just as bad out there as it is in here, goddamn it.
[scoffs]
She’s right!
If we stop right now, that only helps the ones who are dead.
They’ll get a 100 million won and not us.
We made it through! They’re out! That money is ours.
Please! Think about what just happened out there.
Come on, let’s go! [whimpers]
Where am I supposed to go, huh?
Out there, I don’t stand a chance. I do in here.
No, I’ve got nothing out there.
Come on, let’s finish this thing!
I’d rather stay and keep on trying in here than go back to the bullshit out there.
You jerk! You got some kind of death wish? Go die alone!
Don’t drag everybody else into this, you little shit!
What the hell are you doing?
Who are you…
[both gasp]
[masked manager] We will not condone any kind of act
that impedes this democratic process.
Now, let us resume and continue voting.

[masked manager] The majority of the players have voted to terminate the game.
Therefore, this game is now terminated.
Hey! Okay, anybody who wants, they can go.
But let the ones who want, stay till the end, though.
Half of us has died already!
We can’t just stop here!
[Player 212] He’s right! Please let us stay!
We’ll keep playing the game!
[man 5] Yes! Let us continue!
[masked manager] It truly is a pity that we must say goodbye to you like this.
However, we will not completely seal the door of opportunity
for all of you.
If the majority of you wish to participate again,
then we will resume the game.
So, goodbye for now.

Huh?

[both grunting]
Hang on. [Gi-hun panting]
Oh, shit. Where are we?

Hey. Untie me now. Hey!
What are you… Oh, okay.
Get dressed first. It’s cold.
[shivers] I’m freezing too. Oh!
Oh, yeah. [shudders]
Hurry up now.
[shivering]
Oh, that hurts. Hey.
Hey, stop. Come on, it’s my turn now. Huh? Hey!
Wait! Wait. What are you doing? You gotta untie me.
Yeah, why is that?
I just helped you. What the hell?
[scoffs]
Now, aren’t you a little old to be this clueless?
I help untie you,
then you’re just gonna hassle me for your cash again.
Of course, I’m gonna hassle you.
[scoffs]
[Gi-hun] Okay, fine.
Forget the money, okay? Untie me, I beg you.
[Gi-hun quivering]
Seriously?
Yeah. I swear I’ll forget the whole thing.
How can I trust you?
I swear it on my… on my own mother, okay? [panting]
Pretty please.
Oh, it’s freezing. Goddamn it!
That hurts. Shit. [shivers]
[Gi-hun cries]
[Gi-hun whimpers]
[Gi-hun grunts]
Hey, you little… Come here. Get back here.
My money… give it back. Give it back now!
Give it back! [grunts]
Give me my money! Give it back! Ow!
Oh, shit. Give me back the money.
[coughs]
That’s all your mother means to you.
You little… Hold on, you stop right there. Hey!
Hey! Don’t walk away!
God, shit.
[man] Excuse me, sir, where are we?
[Sang-woo] Yeouido.
Where exactly is… Yeouido?
In the center of Seoul.
Uh… sir, sir, do you have a cell phone on you?
Uh, would you let me borrow it, please?
I’ll be quick.
[exhales]

[cashier] That’s 2,000 won.

CYBER POLICE: SUBPOENA HAS BEEN SENT.
SANG-WOO, CALL US NOW AND WE WON’T SUE.
MR. CHO SANG-WOO, YOUR LOANS ARE…
SEOUL POLICE: YOU ARE TO ATTEND AT ONCE.
[cell phone buzzing]
[sighs]
[man slurping]
Thank you, sir.
Hello?
[in Hindi] Hi.
Yes, I had some work.
I’m sorry.
[lighter clicking]
[in English] Here you go. And thanks again, sir.
Have a good night.
Wait. Stop.
Got money for the bus?
Sorry?
You said you live in Ansan.
You couldn’t afford the ramyeon here. Got money for the ride back?
Money.
No. No money.
I’ll walk.
You’ll walk… all the way to Ansan?
Here, take this for the bus ride home.
I can’t. No.
I don’t have money to pay you back.
I won’t ask you to do that. Take it, okay?
[rustling]
Thank you.
Thank you so much, sir.
Listen, I’m not your sir, so stop calling me that.
[man] I’m sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
[Gi-hun] Look, officer.
You’ve gotta realize what a massive deal all of this was.
I know it sounds crazy.
Okay, sir.
So you’re saying that your kidnappers
rounded up hundreds of people and had them play a game.
Then went out there and shot the ones who lost.
[officer 1] Is that right?
Yeah.
And they didn’t just shoot one or two.
Those people had no mercy. They killed more than 200!
What game was it then?
You know Red Light, Green Light?
Wait, that’s for kids.
Is that what they made you play?
Yes.
And they forced adults to do it?
I know how it sounds.
And then they shot everyone who got caught?
How many more times do you want me to say it?
[officer 2] Mister.
So where did they do it? Where’s the place they were killed?
They had me knocked unconscious, so how could I know?
I said I don’t have any freaking clue.
Then give us the killer’s description.
They all had these masks on the whole time we were there.
[officer 2] Then, wait, how did you manage to get out?
Hey, look, the players came together and put it to a vote.
And since the majority wanted to leave…
Hold on, okay?
You said you wanted to stop playing,
and the killers, they told you, “Sure, you can go.” Just like that?
Yeah.
[laughs]
And what made you want to go there?
Well, they…
they promised we would get money, so…
[officer 2] Money?
Yeah.
We’re talking tens of billions of won.
[chuckles]
Okay. Let me just sum up everything you’ve told us so far.
Just so I understand.
You went to play kids’ games
because someone told you you’d get all that cash.
So then they had you play some Red Light, Green Light,
and they shot everyone who got caught.
But when you said you wanted to go, they said, “Okay, just go,”
and you don’t know what they look like or where this all took place.
Is that everything, mister?
Yeah.
What’s your name, sir?
I live in Ssangmun-dong. My name is Seong Gi-hun.
Seong Gi-hun, you got someone who’s taking care of you?
If you want me to help, we can call around and get you to a local medical center.
What do you take me for?
Look, I’m a tax-paying citizen of Ssangmun-dong. Got it?
Here’s their number. It’s on a business card.
Call and see what they say! Jeez!

Um, would you mind if I ask you something?
[woman] Who is this?
Well, I…
[whispers] Hey, you’re not a cop, okay?
Uh… Uh, sorry to call so early.
Could I come play in those games there?
[woman] Games?
Uh, yeah. See, games are my thing, you know.
I’ll play all the games you ask me to.
I’ll do the best…
[woman] Okay. Hold on.
Who the heck are you?
And why are you calling me this early with this nonsense?
If you wanna play games, go to an Internet cafe.
What’s wrong with you, you freaking pervert?
[sniffles]
[Gi-hun] You dialed the wrong number! Let go!
Officer, don’t do this. Please.
We’re sorry, mister. You better go home.
You sure you dialed the right number, huh? Better be sure you did!
You’ll see. Look, I’ll call and put you on the line.
The right number’s on my phone from the call that I made already.
[whispers] Fuck this guy.
[beeps]
[operator] I’m sorry. The number that you have dialed does not exist
or is no longer in service.
Please check the number and try again later.
Please check the number…
Who was that? Was he drunk?
Some crazy hobo guy.
Everything’s crazy around here today.
You, get a grip. Wanna go back in?
Well, I’m out. Have a good one.
[officer 2] Here. Goodbye.
[birds chirping]
Hey, Ma.
It’s your son.
Hmm.
Ma?
Where are you?
[cell phone tinkles, beeps]
[operator] The person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.
Where’d you go? You left the door open and everything.
[Gi-hun] Sang-woo.
What are you doing here?
[sighs]
[both sigh]
Is it because of your debt?
Shh…
Hey, come on, you’re still Ssangmun-dong’s own pride and joy.
You’re still the genius who got accepted to SNU Business School. So don’t worry.
You’ll make money again.
Go tell your mom all about it and make a fresh start.
[scoffs]
Just make…
six billion won?
Six billion?
I thought it was 600 million won.
They don’t know everything there is.
And all those stocks that guy said that you lost, you did that for real?
It wasn’t just stocks now.
[inhales] There was futures too.
Excuse me?
You bet on your future?
[Gi-hun] What kind of bet was it that you used that much money?
Did you get a girlfriend?
Doesn’t mean that future.
[sighs] Just forget it.
[Gi-hun scoffs]
[huffs]
Hey, file for personal bankruptcy then.
Whatever they call it.
I heard you won’t have to pay your debts off if you do that.
I used my own mother’s house as financial collateral.
And her shop.
I put it all on the line.
[exhales]
[phone rings]
[ringing continues]
Who is this?
Yeah, this is he.
What?
24-HOUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER
[Gi-hun] Oh.
[doctor] She’s diabetic.
[sighs]
She left it untreated, and it got worse.
She had to be in a lot of pain recently. You didn’t know?
Will you be able to treat her for it?
In the worst case, she might need to have her feet amputated.
Let’s keep her here for now and see how things go with treatment.
[breathing heavily]
[background chatter]
[Gi-hun] Ma.
Ma!
Mom, where are you going?
He said you need to stay here.
I’m okay.
But you’re not okay.
Hey, Mom, you can’t walk around like that.
Look, just stop it.
[breathing heavily]
You haven’t been home in days now,
out doing whatever it is you’re doing lately,
but now you’re a good son, huh?
Mom, don’t be like this, okay?
You know how bad this thing could get?
Tell me. Say I stay here and they treat me,
who’s going to pay the rent in that case?
Also, do you know how much it costs to be in the hospital,
not to mention how much all the drugs are?
The insurance will help pay for them.
Insurance? Help us?
You canceled all that.
Remember, you ended it and used up all the cash we had.
Will you please just get a grip?
Goodness.
[Gi-hun’s mom sighs]
Gi-hun.
Let’s stop. I’m too tired.
I’m too tired to go on. Stop arguing with me.
Let’s end this.
[Gi-hun’s mom sighs]
[sighs]
Damn it. I’ll get what you need.
I’ll get all the money you need. [sniffs]
Hello, Ma.
Heading over to his apartment right now.
I’m sure he’s fine, okay?
He dodges our calls all the time. You know what he’s like.
I can call everyone who might know places he’s hold up in before.
If I can’t reach him then,
then I’ll go report him missing tomorrow.
I’m a police officer. Have you forgotten that?
I will find him.
[young officer] Yes, Mom. Don’t worry too much.
[distant dog barking]
[young officer] How long has it been since he came by?
Well, I don’t bother tenants every day.
Still, I mean, his rent was due a week ago.
I’ve stopped by every day since then,
he was never here, though, and never picked up his phone.
There.
That’s right. Think you could pay his rent?
Otherwise, you’ll have to come move all of his things out.
I’ll take a look now and pay his rent later.
[landlord giggles]
Well, I’ll be down the hall.

THEORY OF DESIRE, JACQUES LACAN RENÉ MAGRITTE
[foreboding music]
[young officer] Was he drunk?
Some crazy hobo guy.
[officer 1] Everything’s crazy around here today.
Hey, I got ice cream, everyone.
[kids laugh]
What? No ice cream for you, little man?
How did you get your face like that?
Did you get into a fight?
If you’re not gonna talk to me,
I guess I’ll just go.
Wait. I don’t wanna stay here, okay?
Where’s Mom? You said she would come soon.
You told me that we’d be together.
that I just had to wait a month.
Cheol.
Listen…
All the kids told me you lied.
They said I’d never leave and…
They said I’d get abandoned here.
They’re wrong.
[Cheol sniffles]
And Mom and Dad will be here soon.
[Cheol sniffles]
I swear, okay? I’ll make sure that they do.
Don’t worry. Listen, we’ll all live under the same roof next year, okay?
[sniffles]
I’m your big sis.
I always keep my word, don’t I?
[kids chattering, laughing]
Ah, you mean the stupid game guy? That guy?
What do you need his name for, Detective Hwang?
I saw that he looked familiar to me.
I think I know the guy like to a family friend or something.
Really?
Let me think about it.
Something like Saeng or Seong or…
[officer 1] Seong Gi-hun.
Ssangmun-dong is where he lives, right?
You’re right. Seong Gi-hun.
[officer 2] Is he your friend?
Uh, yeah, I’m pretty sure.
Uh, and how about getting his address too?
[machine rumbling]
[worker] Hey, Ali! Long time no see!
Hey, Ali.
[Ali] Why won’t you answer my calls?
You called, huh?
And now you’re here.
[Ali’s boss] What’s up? Is something wrong?
Sir, stop. Pay what you owe me now.
[sighs]
Yeah. Don’t you remember?
I told you, I’ve got no money. Business isn’t going so well.
Look at what working here did to my body, sir.
I couldn’t afford the hospital either. [breathing heavily]
Now look here, I gotta go.
Give me the wages you owe.
[Ali’s boss] Damn it.
Go and ask the rest of my employees if they got their paychecks yet.
I can’t pay anyone till I get the cash!
Hey, I got pain everywhere, Ali.
I’m so damn broke. I need a doctor.
You said you would pay us. Where did it all go?
Six whole months…
Come on.
…and nothing for all our hard work out there.
Hey, you little son of a…
Hah! I’m busy now. We’ll talk later.
[machines rumbling]
Sir, give me my paycheck.
Sir, please give me my money back.
You little shit, don’t touch me.
[Ali] Don’t swear at me!
[both grunting]
[Ali] I saw you have money.
Shut up!
[Ali] My money!
Give it to me!
Let me go, son of a bitch!
[both grunting]
Give me my money!
[grinding]
[screams]
[worker] What did you do, Ali?
Stop that. Hey!
[Ali’s boss screaming]
[screaming continues]
Shit!
[worker] Hey, you can’t just leave!
[panicked shouts]
SOUTHERN MEN, NORTHERN WOMEN
[man] I completely understand what your situation is like.
But you know, it’s…
A broker can’t be tracked down once they’ve fled with all of their money.
You aren’t the only victim.
There’s some who went all the way to Dandong to try and catch this one guy,
they got caught by the Chinese police,
almost got dragged all the way back North.
My options, what are they? What do I do?
[sighs] Get another broker and try it all again.
And I’m sure you already know,
but you’re going to need to start the process over again.
How much is it?
[sighs]
We’re gonna start by finding out your parents location again.
And security around the border is now much tighter,
so the price for helping them cross the river shot up.
So how much then?
[inhales sharply]
So you’ll want…
at least 40 million.
[glass clinks]
Forty million.
You’re only paying to get them to China, though.
If you want to get them to the South then…
[screams]
[man] That burns! Oh, that’s fucking hot.
Damn it. [whimpers]
I trusted you and brought my money here like you told me.
That money is something I risked my own life to get.
[whimpers]
Hey. Uh…
I had no idea. [whimpers]
I didn’t know those people would just run off with all your money.
Please, I swear.
[breathing shakily]
Sure.
I’ll get your money.
You pull anything on me…
[whimpers]
…I’ll rip your fucking throat wide open, and that’s that.
You got it?
[whimpers]
[relieved sigh]
[exhales in relief]
[panicked cries]
SANG-WOO’S FISH STORE
[Sang-woo’s mom] So, have you been eating all right over there?
[Sang-woo] Yes, I’ve been eating well, so don’t worry.
I doubt that greasy American food is doing all that much for you.
Tell me what you’re eating.
[Sang-woo] It’s okay, Mom.
There are lots of Korean restaurants.
Oh, really? That’s great. [chuckles]
So when are you coming back?
Uh, it’s taking longer than expected, so I’m not sure.
It might be a while.
Oh, really?
It sure sounds like it’s been tough there.
Hey, Mom.
Yes? What?
[woman] Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me.
I’ll take three squids, prepped and cleaned.
Ah, yes. Wait just a minute.
Sang-woo, there’s a customer here.
[Sang-woo’s mom] Don’t bring me back anything from your trip.
I don’t need anything over here, okay?
Okay.
My goodness.
I’m just worried that you might get me,
you know, something that’s really way too expensive.
All right, honey, you should go. I love you, Sang-woo.
[Sang-woo’s mom chuckles]
You wanted a squid…
[line beeps]
[scoffs]
[Sang-woo’s mom] Oh, he always gets me a little something
whenever he goes on one of his trips, he takes for work. Ah!
[giggles]
A gentleman too. Sounds amazing.
He went to SNU.
For Business.
Come on, Business at SNU?
[chuckles]
[woman] And he’s not just smart, he’s handsome too.
Is he married yet?
Not yet. He’s single.
[woman] How old is he?
I know someone he might like.
Well, the man’s standards are set pretty high.
[chuckles]
[detective] Hi there. Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Cho Sang-woo’s mother?
Uh, yeah. Cho Sang-woo. Yes, he’s my son, sir.
Do you know where your son happens to be now?
On business in the United States. Uh…
Why do you ask, sir?
Well, we’re the police.
I’m afraid that Mr. Cho Sang-woo has a warrant out for his arrest.
He’s charged with forgery, embezzlement, crimes that are all…
some form of financial fraud.
Huh?
No, you can’t be right.
[rain pattering]
Uh, no, detectives. You know what, you know what, there’s a mistake.
I know that my son wouldn’t do anything illegal. So…
Listen, I’m sure you love him a lot.
If he contacts you, just tell him to come to us.
If he keeps avoiding us like this,
when they put him on trial, it’s gonna look bad.

TIME: MIDNIGHT, JUNE 23 PLACE: SAME AS PREVIOUS
[thunder rumbles]
[Ali’s wife in Hindi] Where did you get this money?
Ali, where did you get this money?
[in Hindi] Listen carefully.
Buy tickets for the earliest flight for you and our kid and go home first.
What about you?
You two should go first.
I’ll be there as soon as my job here is done.
Something is going on with you, right?
Don’t ask anything for now.
You need to pack up and leave right away.
I hope you can understand my problem.
I love you. You and our child.
[Ali’s wife sobbing]
[Gi-hun’s friend] I don’t have any money.
HEALING PUB
[Gi-hun] Just lend me three million won, please.
I’ll pay it all back.
Friends shouldn’t talk to each other like this.
You know how strapped for cash we both are.
I know that. Of course.
You think I’m happy asking you for cash, huh?
Look, I’ll come and make deliveries for you, okay?
I’m not paying for delivery man right now. Look at my bar.
Just the rent is too much.
[rain pattering]
I’ll pay you in a month, okay? Huh?
I’ll continue my chauffeuring and come help around here.
Listen.
They told me she needs to get surgery right away.
Hey, honey.
You should get back in here, okay?
I will soon.
Get in here right now, okay? And put that out.
[inaudible dialogue]
Hello.
[woman] Gi-hun.
Yeah?
Coming out to someone’s nice pub and smoking outside is rude.
Oh, yeah.
[rain pouring]
[thunder rumbles]
[sighs]
[Player 1] Wait.
Aren’t you…
Oh, it’s a small world.
It’s you.
You are Player 456, right?
Uh, yeah.
I’m, um… [stammers]
That’s me. Yeah.
What are the chances?
So then, what are you doing around here?
Actually, I live right down the road.
[Player 1] Oh.
[chuckles] I see.
And you?
Ah.
You come from around this area as well?
Uh, no. [chuckles]
I have a friend who lives nearby. So…
[laughs]
There isn’t anywhere for this old man to go.
I’m just staying there for a while.
[Player 1 chuckles]
Uh, goodness.
Uh…
Would you like to sit down?
Sure.
[both chuckle]
What are the odds you’re here at the same time as me?
What are the odds, right?
You know I think…
that we were destined to meet here.
[chuckles]
[Player 1 sighs]
Uh, would you like a little?
Mm. Sure. [chuckles]
Uh…
Is your head okay? Are you allowed to drink?
It’s all right. [chuckles]
[Player 1 grunts]
[chuckles]
[slurping]
Uh, sorry. I wish I have some food for the two of us.
[Player 1] Ah.
It’s okay.
[plastic rustles]
[Player 1 clears throat]
[chuckles]
[laughs]
[in muffled voice] Oh, hey, hold on.
You’re absolutely sure you could have this much?
I mean, you had a lot of already.
Mm-hm.
[thunder rumbles]
[slurps]
I…
decided to going again.
Hmm. Go where?
[Player 1 clears throat]
You’re going there?
Since my…
time’s almost out as it is.
I don’t want…
to sit around waiting to die.
That sounds pathetic.
And who knows
I still could go and win the whole thing.
When we played Red Light, Green Light,
I got to the line even before you did.
How could you wanna go there?
But as soon as I got back here,
I got some harsh reminders. Yeah, what they say is true.
Out here, the torture is worse.
[chuckles]
[somber music]
[thunder rumbles]
[fanfare music playing in the carnival]
[thug] Hey, boss!
What took you so long?
All these stupid drunks got into a huge fight
as I was about to leave the bar and head here.
Ah, you know how it goes. [chuckles]
Something about a Friday night always brings out the weirdos.
The money?
Oh.
I couldn’t get more on short notice.
I’ll make sure the rest will come in soon, okay?
And anyways, the Big Boss sent out all the boys to find you
Incheon and Ilsan, the whole damn place had eyes.
[scoffs]
Where have you been hiding?
We better not discuss that out here. Did you drive here?
Yeah, this way.
[engine revs]
So this is the invitation from that whole Red Light, Green Light game, huh?
Yeah.
This one came yesterday.
They’re starting up again.
So then, we go on Tuesday. Gather all the boys and meet us there.
Get some guns for us too.
Guns?
They’ve got guns, yeah.
Still, the pickup is only one guy.
We’ll beat up those masked shitheads,
and then we break in and take all the cash.
I don’t know. How am I supposed to know how much of that is true?
You bastard. Come on, tell me what you’re getting at.
Sorry, boss.
So they’ve got tens of billions of won up in a huge piggy bank up there.
As long as we hit them with everything we got,
no more dealing with those stupid drunks at bars to make barely anything, assholes.
[chuckles]
Uh, boss, hold on.
All the guys… you went into hiding because you mess with the Big Boss.
At this point, all of Incheon knows.
Ahh!
I doubt I’d be able to convince anyone.
Hey, look here, you jerk.
We’re gonna do this so I can get the money I owe him.
So…
in the Philippines, how did you lose so much money at the casino?
How did you know that?
Boss, you should’ve known not to go pushing your luck, you know.
You little piece of shit.
Deok-su.
“Deok-su”?
[laughs]
[car horn honks]
[tires screeching]
The guys from the casino came here looking for you.
They’ll take your liver, your kidneys, and your eyes for the money you owe.
[laughs]
And now you’re gonna die, you fucking asshole!
[cackles]
[screams]
[grunts]
[tense music]
[man chokes]
[tense music continues]
Hey! Welcome to Korea!
Welcome!
I killed Deok-su, okay?
Come on! Come at me, you bastards.
[goon 1] Hey!
[goon 2] Go! Kill Deok-su!
[goon 3] Get him!
[splashes]
[Ga-yeong’s mom] Money?
[Gi-hun] Yeah.
[Ga-yeong’s mom] How much?
[Gi-hun] About…
two million won.
[Ga-yeong’s mom] Two million won?
Yeah.
You think you can come here and ask for that?
You never paid child support or any alimony or help us with anything.
And now you’re asking us to give you money?
I’m sorry. It’s for… my mom.
She was in the hospital.
[sighs]
And how bad is it?
She has diabetes.
[inhales sharply] She needs surgery.
[sighs deeply]
[Gi-hun clicks tongue]
Well, I’m broke.
Things have been hard. [exhales]
[Gi-hun clicks tongue]
Please, I’m begging you.
Mom was always really good to you.
Look how desperate I was to ask you.
And I’ll give it back.
I really am broke.
I just get money from my husband.
Well, then could you, could you ask him for it?
You crazy?
Hey. [scoffs]
And what am I supposed to tell him it’s for if he asks, huh?
[sighs deeply]
Out. Now.
Hey.
The kids’ dad will be here soon.
Go.
Hey.
What the hell do you think you’re doing calling him her dad?
I’m her real father, okay?
Oh, yeah? Tell me more.
Go ahead. Why don’t you tell me what you did to deserve to be her dad?
You… Were you there when she was born? Didn’t think so.
[shaky breath] You know that…
I told you all that, okay.
[sighs]
And you know why I couldn’t go.
Someone collapsed at work.
Yeah, well, I fainted too. [sobs]
I was alone and had to crawl just to get myself over to the hospital.
And if I’d been any later, she’d be dead!
No, I watched that guy die!
With my own eyes!
But no hospital, though. He couldn’t go!
[door lock beeping]
[door lock chimes]
[door opens]
Honey, we’re home.
[Ga-yeong’s mom] You’re home early.
[door lock chimes]
Um, hi, Dad.
Hi, Mom!
Come on in here, guys. He stopped by to see Ga-yeong.
Um…
And now that I saw her, I’ll get going.
You’re going?
Yeah, I have an important meeting to go to.
Ga-yeong, bye now.
I’ll see you soon.
Hmm.
[door rattles]
[Gi-hun] How do you open…
Here.
[door chiming]
[Gi-hun] Thanks.
[door lock chimes]
[Ga-yeong’s stepdad] Why did he come here this time?
Why did you let him in the house?
[Ga-yeong’s mom] I’m sorry.
I was coming back from the market, and he was waiting at the front door.
[rain pouring]
[Ga-yeong’s stepdad] Wait.
What is that?
You needed money.
[sighs]
Thanks so much.
Uh, I swear I’ll pay you back.
[Ga-yeong’s stepdad] You don’t have to.
Instead, you can stop trying to contact our family.
It’s tough for Ga-yeong, but…
we’re moving to the US soon.
If you just keep showing up… [grunts]
You asshole!
Do you think money solves everything?
[Gi-hun breathing heavily]
[Ga-yeong] Dad, why?
[dramatic music]
[dramatic music continues]
Seong Gi-hun?
Yeah?
Hwang Jun-ho, police.
You recently made a report at the station, right?
You said a group abducted people and make them play games.
And you also said…
some players were killed too.
Oh, all that? Yeah, I just made that up.
Yeah, a story I made up when I was drunk.
They sent a card to my brother
just like the one you had, sir.
He went missing a few days ago.
I just found it, I don’t know.
I saw it on the street and just put it in my pocket.
Mr. Seong.
You can help me.
I need to get him back.

Why would you think…
that I will be useful to you or anybody else?

Seong Gi-hun is down on his luck and has enormous debts with loan sharks. While at a train station, he’s asked by a well-dressed man to play a game of ddakji, where if he wins a round he’ll get 100,000 won, but if he loses then the man will slap his face. After playing, the man gives Gi-hun a card, inviting him to play games with higher stakes. Gi-hun accepts and is taken, while unconscious, to a mysterious location with 455 other players who awaken in a dorm and are identified by numbers on their clothes. The location is managed by masked staff, and overseen by the Front Man, also masked. The players are all in similarly dire financial straits and will be given billions of won in prize money if they win six games over six days. Gi-hun befriends Player 001, an elderly man, and recognizes among the players Cho Sang-woo, a former classmate and businessman, and Player 067, a pickpocket who once stole his money. The first game is Red Light, Green Light where those who lose are gunned down on the spot. Gi-hun, though terrified, is encouraged by Sang-woo to play, and is saved from falling by Player 199. All three are able to complete the game.

[drum beating]
[drum beating continues]
[flute blowing]
[man] In my town, we had a game called the “Squid Game.”
We called it that because it’s played in a court shaped like a squid.
The rules are simple.
Children are divided into two groups, the offense and the defense.
Once the game starts, the defense can run around on two feet within bounds,
while the offense outside the lines are only allowed to hop on one foot.
It’s your mom.
[man] But if an attacker cuts through the waist of the squid passing defense,
then they are given freedom to use both feet.
[playful music]
Inspector royal.
[man] Inspector royal.
For whatever reason, we called that the inspector royal.
When we were ready for the final battle,
all the attackers gathered at the entrance to the squid.
Go.
[man] In order to win,
the attackers must tap the small closed-off space
on the squid’s head with their foot.
But if someone on the defense manages to push you
outside of the squid’s boundaries,
you die.
That’s right. You die.
[playful music continues]
[shirt tearing]
[playful music]
[playful music rising]
Victory!
[kids cheering]
[man] Victory.
Once you tap the squid’s head, you win and yell out, “Victory.”
At that moment, I felt as if I owned the entire world,
exhilarated.
[drum beating]
[drum beating continues]
[woman] Ah.
Um…
Is this my daily allowance or what?
No. Remember, Ga-yeong’s birthday is today?
[sighs]
Yeah. Of course, I do.
[woman] And don’t forget, go and get her, uh, something for dinner later.
Well, I can’t buy her a nice meal with these much. Times are tough.
Ga-yeong loves fried chicken, you know.
Go buy her some fried chicken.
Just chicken, Mom?
Don’t you think I should get a present for her?
Give me some more, huh?
[woman grunts] I’m broke.
[man] What are you talking about?
I gave you everything I made chauffeuring.
Oh, please, that petty change?
Hey, we can’t even pay your loan’s monthly interest off with that.
[woman grunts]
We can’t do that now, and we barely spend anything.
[grunts]
Let’s use some when we have to.
[woman] Goodness.
Oh.
[woman groans]
And will you stop working so much?
[woman] Make sure you soak the dishes after you’re done.

Any kid knows that.
Hey!

[lender 1] Hey, get him!
[lender 2] Get him! Over there! Over there!
[grunts]
Wait a minute. Let me stand up.
Okay. Just… Look, I got cash for real.
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh. [heavy breathing]
Then why did you run, huh?
Because I…
I, I’ve been saving up so I… I could pay you all the ones that I took.
[chuckles]
Goodness, what a trooper. Look at you.
[grunts]
So then, how much you got?
[pants] Four million.
Take this amount now. I’ll pay the rest next month, so…
What…
Oh! [grunts]
Hey, kid, you okay?
Oh. [groans]
Let me see. Oop, oop, oop, opp, oop,
[groaning]
Come on, let me see.
Poor thing.
[Gi-hun breathing heavily]
Ahh…
Got a sweet taste of it.
I guess you’re still eating well. Spending the money you know is mine.
I swear I had it…
I had it, I had your money.
Look, I bet on six and eight and they won, so I had the cash right here.
Hey.
[Gi-hun breathing shakily]
[panting]
[grunting]
Do you know why nosebleeds are so easy to get, huh?
[whimpering]
Because there are so many capillaries.
Oh, no. Hey, don’t do this.
I don’t wanna die.
[lender 1] Your blood was tasty.
I think my boys and I should make a nice delicious soup in it.
I’ll pay you! [sobs]
I’ll pay you. I mean it. I’ll pay you. [whimpers]
[crying]
Jesus, guy.
Don’t make me feel sorry for you with all that crying.
How did you know I was such a softie?
[sobs]
Hey.
[crying]
Okay, wipe off your tears.
Sign here and your fingerprint.
If you don’t pay it off by next month, I’ll take one of your kidneys.
And then after that, I’ll take one of your eyes. Okay?
You don’t like it?
No, uh, I got it. Yeah.
Next month is good with me. [breathing heavily]
Here.
Okay.
Well, I, I need ink.
[grunts]
[whimpers]
[lender 1 chuckles]
There, you got your ink. It’s all natural too.
Huh? [whimpers]
Oh.
[lender 1] That’s it. Right there.
DISCLAIMER OF PHYSICAL RIGHTS
[chuckles] You did it, huh!
You have one month. Take care of yourself.
Uh, hold on. Sir, excuse me.
I’m sorry to even ask but… [stammers]
may I please borrow 10,000 won?
[scoffs] You little…
[lender 1] Forget it.
[goons laughing]
WINDOW CLOSED
[Gi-hun] Excuse me.
Sorry to do this.
Uh…
Can I get back that 10,000?
[Gi-hun sighs]
THE FUN DOESN’T END, CRANE GAME
[kids yell excitedly]
[claw machine beeping]
[whirs]
[Gi-hun] Come on.
[frustrated scream]
[whirring]
Ah!
[claw machine beeping]
[Gi-hun yells]
Yeah. Come on. That’s it, that’s it.
That’s right. Ah!
[grumbles]
[yells]
Goddamn it!
[boy] Excuse me, sir.
You need to stop and pick the prize you want first.
Does that help you?
[guitar strums]
[claw machine beeping]
[rattling, clacking]
[Gi-hun] Ah. Ah…
That’s it. Good.
[whirring]
Yes, that’s it.
Oh!
Yay!
[both cheering]
[boy] Yay!
[both laugh]
[Gi-hun whooping]
Great job! Thank you. Thank you!
[both laugh]
[Gi-hun guffawing]
[boy] Yay!
[distant car honking]
Oh, this?
It’s a huge mosquito bite, that’s all.
Mosquitoes are really mean these days. Yeah.
Dad, you can be in all of the fights that you want,
but don’t get hurt too bad.
I’m sorry, sweetie. I really am.
You know, I wanted to buy you a nicer dinner than this.
It’s okay.
We went with my stepdad to a steakhouse earlier, so…
A steak, huh?
That’s nice of him.
Well, I still want tteokbokki a lot more, though.
[sighs]
[whispers] I’m not allowed to have it at home.
Mom says it’s junk food.
[Gi-hun chuckles]
[both laugh]
Eat up then.
Oh, my gosh.
Surprise.
Ga-yeong, I got your present right here.
[muffled gasp]
[Gi-hun chuckles]
[Gi-hun] Ah…
Uh…
You know why, huh? These days, even women go to war.
Uh-huh.
I mean, when you finally get older,
there’s not gonna be that kind of discrimination like we got now.
And you’ll need to get used to this pretty soon, you know.
[clacking]
Ah. [chuckles]
Oh, plus, it’s a lighter. [laughs]
Looks like the real deal, doesn’t it? [chuckles]
[laughs awkwardly]
I think you’ll get in trouble with Mom again
if she saw me holding this.
Is that right?
I’ll keep it then, just till you get a little bit older. Okay?
Hey, don’t smoke of it, though.
Oh, come on, I’m clean now.
[sniffing]
[chuckles]
All right. All right.
I’ll make sure I’ll stop smoking for real.
And you’ll see next year, huh, I’ll get an awesome present for you, okay?
Ga-yeong, I swear.
Next year?
Last year, you had a birthday.
This one came right around, right?
And the next one will be quick.
Um, Dad?
Hmm? Shoot.
Nothing. [nervous chuckle]
Okay. Come on, come on. Have more tteokbokki.
Excuse me, sir, one more order, okay?
And mix it with some of that in.
[sighs]
[Ga-yeong’s mom] Why did you bring her back so late?
She’s not dressed for the cold.
Oh, she got sleepy, I carried her.
We’re ten minutes late at most. Okay?
I said I’d drive down to get her, didn’t I?
It’s her birthday. Let’s not yell.
[Ga-yeong] Mom.
Oh.
Hey, Ga-yeong, hey, get down.
I’ll carry her to the elevator if you don’t mind, okay?
She can walk on her own.
[Ga-yeong] Mom…
Ga-yeong, get down.
Ah, jeez. Seriously.
[Ga-yeong’s mom] All right. Let’s go.
[Ga-yeong] Bye, Dad.
[Gi-hun] Go on in. Good night.
[sighs]
[train alarm beeping]
[Gi-hun] Ah, wait a minute! Hey, open the door!
Ah, shit!
[panting]
[train squealing]
[Gi-hun sighs]
[train speeding up]
[exhales sharply]
[footsteps approaching]
[Gi-hun sighs]
[scoffs]
[exhales]
Hello, sir.
Can I talk to you?
I don’t believe in Jesus.
[sighs]
It’s not that.
Listen, I wanna let you in on a great opportunity to…
[clicks]
[man sighs]
I come from a very long line of Buddhists, so find another guy to preach to,
Mister.
Would you like to play a game with me?
[sighs]
Who are you?
Salesman, huh?
You people have all kinds of tactics.
And I know you’re only doing your job, but I really don’t have time to sit here…
[guitar strums]
I’m sure you’ve played ddakji before, right?
Play a few round of ddakji with me.
And each time you win, I’ll pay you a 100,000 won.
[Gi-hun scoffs]
Wait, so if I hit your ddakji, and it flips over,
I get a 100,000 won?
And if I can flip yours, you will give me the exact same amount of money.
You can also be the first to play.
Hey, look, I had a bad day today.
You pull a scam or you rip me off, well, then, I’ll… I’ll kill you, huh?
So then it’s my turn, eh?
So which color do you wanna play as?
[grunts]
[frustrated grunt] Shh…
Well, what’s wrong?
So the thing is…
How about you use your body to pay?
A what? [grunts]
What the hell, man?
I’ll take a 100 grand off per slap.
[frustrated sigh]
One more round.
[alarm beeping]
[loud clacking]
[Gi-hun] One more round.

[guffawing] Did you see that? I beat you, man!
[Gi-hun laughing] Did you see that? I did it. I won.
Get over here. It’s my turn to do this.
[Gi-hun grunts]
What are you doing, jerk? [grunts]
Your 100 grand.
[rustling]
You’re welcome, sir.
Oh, yeah.
The money.
[train chugging]
[man] You know, sir.
There are other games like this where you can make even more.
Come on, it must sound tempting.
[scoffs]
Hey, dude.
Is this some new pyramid scheme or what?
Look, I’m desperate, okay?
Still, not that desperate yet.
[scoffs]
[man] Mr. Gi-hun.
[foreboding music]
Earlier, you signed away your physical rights.
Your name, Seong Gi-hun. 47 years old.
You attended Daehan Technical High School.
Worked at Dragon Motors, Assembly Team One.
The company laid you off ten years ago.
Opened a chicken shop, and then a small snack bar.
Both of them failed, you’re working as a chauffeur right now.
You’ve been divorced for about three years,
and your daughter is ten years old.
A hundred and sixty million won owed just to loan sharks,
and you owe 250 more to the bank.
Who are you?
What business of yours is all that?
We don’t have many spots left.
Just think about it.
[foreboding music continues]

All right, then. [chuckles]

You drink at all tonight?
[laughs] No.
I haven’t had a drop, but I feel tipsy still, anyway.
Because look what I got. [cackles]
Gi-hun, what did you do now? You gambled again?
Don’t you look at me like that. I didn’t.
I earned it all this time. It’s all legit.
[vendor] What’s with your face, by the way?
What’d they try to beat you up for now?
Hey.
[Gi-hun] Forget it.
Sang-woo been around here?
How’s he doing at work?
Always keeping busy.
Right now, he’s on a business trip abroad.
Ah, ungrateful prick.
Tell him to give me a call when he gets back in town.
After all I did?
He got into Seoul National University, thanks to me.
I used to take him to school when we were young.
That’s why he went to school, got a good job.
He at least ought to buy me a drink.
What are you talking about now? Here, take this home, okay?
Not to a bar. Go straight home.

Answer me right now!
It was nothing like that!
Hold on. Are you saying this money is stolen?
I didn’t steal anything, Mom. I earned it all.
I worked, okay. All day, I worked my hands and face off to earn this money for us.
Oh, gosh.
[Gi-hun munching]
So did you get fried chicken for Ga-yeong?
Yes, I got her dinner…
and my present and everything. It was nice.
And did anything come up tonight?
Like what?
[deep inhale]
Ga-yeong, her mother, and her stepdad are all going somewhere.
They’re moving to the US next year.
And you’ll see next year, huh. I’ll get an awesome present for you. Okay?
Ga-yeong, I swear.
Next year?
The US?
That’s right.
Her stepdad’s job begins soon and needs him to go.
So the entire family is going to move there.
[sighs]
I see.
You hear me? How can you eat anything right now, huh?
You need to get your daughter to stay here.
And how do I do that?
We’re done. We settled that when we agreed to the divorce.
[sighs]
I talked to that young man upstairs who knows the law,
and he said that the father has to show the child
will have financial support, and when you can prove that…
then you can take custody. Huh?
If she moves to the US, you know what will happen?
She’ll forget how to speak Korean.
She won’t be able to talk to you like she can right now.
You’re going to become a stranger to her.
[both exhale]
Are you sure that you…
can really keep going without seeing your little girl?

Fifty-five, fifty-six.
Excuse me, sir.
And then, there are those…
What are you doing?
Stop talking to me or I lose count.
And so I was at 50, so the…
Ah, you must be trying to count how many of us there are, is that right?
That’s right. So could you stop talking to me for a while?
And then… Huh?
Hold on.
Where was I just then?
Up on the board, sir. There are 456 here.
[man 1 clears throat]
Oh. Look, that means you were given the number one.
And I’m… Oh.
I’m the last.
[chuckles]
I know all that too.
I’m just counting the numbers.
My doctor said counting is good so I don’t get dementia or anything.
If dementia’s a concern for you, then what are you doing here?
I think you’d wanna stay at home,
let your daughter-in-law cook your meals for you.
Go sit on a coffee chair somewhere.
And look at your grandkids, I think.
You think so?
What about both of your parents?
Do they get nice food cooked by their daughter-in-law all day long?
[man 1 sighs, coughs]
I don’t have much time left now.
Huh?
The doctor said there’s a…
a lump inside over here. Growing every day.
Your… your head?
Brain tumor.

[man 2] You little shit!
[man 3] Stop them!
[background chatter]
[man 2 laughs]
[panting]
Hey!
Wow.
It really is a small world, huh!
Look at those eyes. You still have that temper, huh.
Then again…
nobody broke your spirit, you could always take a hit.
I took care of you,
I fed you, I taught you when you had nowhere else.
This is what I get?
You took more from me than whatever I might possibly owe.
If all of that’s true, how come you ran then?
Well, I didn’t. I went independent.
Hmm. [cackles]
“Independent”?

Come on then, go wave a flag.
Oh, that’s right.
You’re from North Korea, huh? Then wave theirs. Hmm?
Damn you! [grunts]
[woman groans]
Hey, you come here. Hold still.
Oh. That scar on your neck.
You’re the damn pickpocket! You loser.
My money, give it back. Where is it?
You took it. I need it… Ah!
[crowd gasps]
[Gi-hun] What the hell?
Who are you?
Uh…
What do you think you’re doing?
Me? Uh, well… Look.
The name’s Seong Gi-hun. I live in Ssangmun-dong.
Hey, Ssangmun-dong shit.
Yeah?
This little bitch and I weren’t done talking.
Yeah, I understand that. It’s just there’s something that me and this…
woman should talk about urgently.
[sighs]
[man 2] You bastard!
What scheme are you two running?
[mocking laugh] You’re asking me?
What’s your problem with this girl, 101?
Yeah, I’ll bet that, that you’re a thug who preys on girls
that takes advantage of them.
Did you tell her to rob me like that?
You little son of a bitch!
Get away! Hey!
[crowd gasps]
Hey, he wants to hit me.
This thug is trying to hit me, huh!
Hey, somebody get over here! We need help!

Oh! Oh, there they are!
Over here. She’ll pick all our pockets, sir.

Him too. They’ll pick, they’ll pick…

[breathing heavily]
[masked manager] I would like to extend a heartfelt welcome to you all.
Everyone here will participate in six different games over six days.
Those who win all six games will receive a handsome cash prize.
[man 3] And why should we believe that?
Y-You took all our stuff and put us to sleep coming here,
and then you brought us to this strange warehouse.
Now you’re saying you’ll pay us if we go and play a few games?
You really expect us to buy that?
[masked manager] We reluctantly took all of those measures
to maintain confidentiality as we brought you here.
We’ll return everything once the games are over.
You all… you all have masks. Why are you wearing those things?
[masked manager] We do not disclose the faces
and personal information of our staff to any of the participants.
It’s a measure we take to ensure fair games and confidentiality.
Please understand.
Well, I don’t believe you one bit. You got that?
You tricked us. We were kidnapped.
You can make as many excuses as you want
to make sure nobody knows you broke the law in here.
If you’re going to make up for that, then we’re gonna need something more.
[masked manager] Player 218, Cho Sang-woo.

Former team leader of Team Two at Joy Investments.
Siphoned money off from his clients’ balances,
then invested it in derivatives and futures options and failed.

119, No Sang-hun, 1.39 billion in debt.
369, Park Ju-un, 900 million in debt.
Every person standing here in this room is living on the brink of financial ruin.
You all have debts that you can’t pay off.
When we first went to see each of you, not a single one of you trusted us.
But as you all know, we played a game,
and as we promised, gave you money when you won.
And suddenly, everyone here trusted us.
You called and volunteered to participate in this game of your own free will.
So this is it.
I’ll give you one last chance to choose.
Will you go back to living your old and depressing lives
getting chased by your creditors?
Or will you act and seize this last opportunity we’re offering here?
[all murmuring]
Hey! Which games are we playing here?
[masked manager] In order to play fair,
we cannot disclose any information about the games ahead of time.
[Gi-hun] One question.
If we win, just how much do we get?
[remote beeps]
[top door opening]
[quirky music]
[masked manager] Your prize money will be accumulated in there after every game.
We will disclose the amount to everyone after the first game is over.
If you do not wish to participate, then please let us know at this time.

You will be playing Red Light, Green Light.

If your movement is detected afterward, you will be eliminated.
Red Light, Green Light?
The thing we did as kids in the playground?
[woman on PA] Let me repeat the rule.
I think that’s what she said.
[Player 250] Red Light, Green Light?
Is this a joke?
[woman on PA] You’re allowed to move…
Do you think they’re serious?
…when “it” shouts out, “Green Light.”
Well then, bet on the first one there?
Stop when “it” shouts, “Red Light.”
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.
A million won.
Deal?

[closing theme music](\^**^/)(\^**^/)Original release date: September 17, 2021
Jun-ho secretly watches the Front Man receive a call, saying that all will be settled before the VIPs arrive. For the fourth game, players are told to pair up. Sang-woo is with Ali, Gi-hun with Player 001, and Sae-byeok with Player 240. As there are an odd number of players, Mi-nyeo is last man standing and taken away. In the game, everyone is told to play a marble game of their choice against their partner, and whoever gets all their partner’s marbles within 30 minutes will win. Sae-byeok and Player 240, Ji-yeong, agree to play a simple all-or-nothing game, but after talking about their lives Ji-yeong decides Sae-byeok has more to live for and lets her win. Sang-woo almost loses, but tricks Ali into giving up his marbles and wins. Gi-hun, about to lose a betting game to Player 001, turns it around by using Player 001’s failing memory against him. Player 001 reveals that he knew that Gi-hun was tricking him the whole time despite his failing condition, but allows Gi-hun to win anyway. Before being killed, Player 001 says that his name is Oh Il-nam.

Go away.
[masked supervisor] What should we do?
[Front Man] Begin the next game.

Sir, let me help.
[Player 1 breathing heavily]
Thanks so much.

You look great, sir.

[masked manager] Players, what you witness before you is what remains of those who broke the rules for their own benefit.
They tainted the pure and fair ideology everything here has been built upon.
Each and every one of you is considered an equal within the walls of this facility.
You must be guaranteed the same opportunities without being disadvantaged or facing any kind of discrimination.
We truly apologize for allowing such an unacceptable incident to occur.

Front Man speaking.
Yes. A minor disturbance took place.
But it’s being addressed.
No need to worry.
We’ll make sure there’s no trace of the disturbance
by the time the VIPs arrive.
Yes, sir. The game will begin on time, in line with the schedule.

I’ll kill that little slut.
[woman on PA] Players, welcome to the fourth game.
For this game, you will be playing in teams of two.
Please look around and find someone you wish to play with.
When two people agree to play together,
shake hands to show you have become partners.

[Mi-nyeo] Hey, handsome.
Let’s do this, huh?
I’m better than you think.
And I’m stronger than most guys too.
Guess what? I know how to con just about anybody I see.
I’m not a genius, but I still got it work out. Huh?
Hey, let me play with you.
Then I’ll be your dream girl all night long.
[inhales, exhales]
I’ll do anything you tell me. I’m not a regular girl.
Hmm?
Hmm?
[players murmuring]
You’re pretending that you do not want me on your team. Is that it?
Why? Can’t decide?
Want me to choose instead, huh?
[Sae-byeok] Stop embarrassing yourself.
No one will want to play with you like this.
[Mi-nyeo sighs]
And you should all be honest.
You don’t want a girl to team up with or an old guy.
Of course we don’t. We could die.
We already almost die in the previous round.
This man is right.
And it was Adam’s rib the Lord used to make Eve after all.
And that’s the reason that we’re choosing men.
They played different roles than women.
You idiot.
We’re not playing in Eden right now.
Uh, hold on a second.
Why? You want a girl?
You’re all idiots.
You two, you’re making a big mistake, and you’re going to regret it.
[sighs]
Sang-woo, let’s…
Ali, let’s join forces.
Most of these games here, you need to be strong or smart to win.
And I think if we’re a team, we’ll…
we’ll beat a lot of the others out there.
[background chatter]
[chuckles] Uh, uh, no, no, no, no, no.
Uh, it’s okay, really, it’s…
Uh, you two will make a great team together.
I’ll find someone to play with.
[chuckles]
[Player 244] Let’s make this work.
[sighs]
[background chatter]
Sir…
Sorry, but, um…
You know it’s just, um…
Uh…
You should go put this on.
Just in case people here…
Well, they might look down on you for missing it.
[exhales]
[ticking]
You and me…
We’ll be the best team.
[both chuckling]
[indistinct chatter]
[Player 240] Hey.
Wanna do this?
Why should I?
I can’t picture you going around here and begging these jerks.
Hmm? Embarrassing.
What matters is winning. Embarrassing or not.
[Player 240] Then play with me.
I’ll make sure that you win.
What will you do?
Whatever it takes.
What do you see in me?
Well, I wanted to ask you that.
You were someone who looked like they would come with me.
That’s how I feel.
I promise, okay? There’s no option left here.
I teach Math at a high school.
And I can run too. Soccer every day.
Everyone was asking, but I held out so you and I could win.
‘Cause you and me would be great together.
[chuckles]
The… the thing is… [sighs]
…we don’t know which game we’re playing, so…
Hey, choose me so it can just be done.
At this rate, nobody will be left for you, and you won’t continue.
You know,
since the man who’d been cheating is gone, there’s an uneven number.
Once everyone is in pairs, there’ll be one person.
And what happens to that one?
What do you think?
They’ll be out and they’ll get killed.
I would guess that old man there.
[indistinct chatter]
[sighs]
[Player 62] Stop dragging this out.
Let’s play together.
[Gi-hun] Hey, old man.
Wanna do this together?
[woman on PA] The time for finding a partner is now over.
[Mi-nyeo] You guys, you’re all making a big mistake.
Do you really think you can win without me on your team?
It’s me, Han Mi-nyeo!
I’ve made suckers out of everyone there is from Dongducheon to Gangnam!
Guys…
[breathing shakily]
What if you have to play Gonggi or Elastics?
I’m an expert in those.
Babe, please, play with me. Boys aren’t very good at those.
[Player 17] Hey. Get off.
Come back!
Hey, come on, be my partner.
[Player 69] Oh.
Let’s show everyone with a dick they’re wrong!
Let her go.
After us, we need to stick together.
[woman] My gosh!
[Mi-nyeo] I work well with women too!
I’ll be really good! I’ll be…
Stop it!
[whimpering]
Hey, don’t trust this scumbag.
Okay, okay.
He’s a jerk. He’s just gonna throw you under the bus.
Okay, sure.
Look at me.
That dead doctor and him worked together.
Okay.
He played you.
He just wanted to save his own ass, so he kept it secret from you all.
Tell me if I’m wrong, you jerk!
He was with him, guards!
Hey.
He deserves to die too!
Let… let go, bitch!
[door closes]
[breathing shakily]
[tense music]
What? Hey, hold on a second.
Why is the room empty?
I still need a partner.
Hold on. Where did they go?
Who… who took my partner?
What’s going on here? You can’t do this! [panicked screaming]
Hey, I need a partner!
[Mi-nyeo screaming] Let me go! Please!
Bring my partner here, you jerks!
Where’s my partner?
I’m so sick of that whore. [chuckles]
It’s nice to think she won’t be in my way again.
[both scoff]
And, uh…
what she said about you in there,
you working with the doctor…
It’s nothing.
That brat was so desperate, she said whatever she could.
[woman on PA] Attention. All players, please follow the staff
to your designated positions for the game.
[suspenseful music]
[Sang-woo] Ali.
Look at me. No one can stop us if we work together.
I think you and I could really win the money.
All right, let’s do this and get out.
That money is ours to give to both our families.
Let’s do it.
[suspenseful music continues]
[Player 1] You know, when I was a kid,
I live in a neighborhood just like this.
[chuckles] So did I.
And you know something?
Our alleyway looked very similar.
Really?
[chuckles]
[woman on PA] Players, please take one bag each
from the staff member before you.
[objects clinking]
There should be a set of ten marbles in each bag.
Please check to confirm the number.
[inhales] It’s marbles.
Old man, we’re gonna be playing with this.
[Player 1] Hmm.
Are you familiar with it?
Ah, yes, very familiar.
Used to have a lot as a kid. Ah!
Oh, yes, back in the day.
And you know, I was pretty good.
[Gi-hun snickers]
Not too bad myself.
[both chuckle]
Ah, that’s good news.
Yeah.
I’m glad it’s not just about our strength.
That means you and I are…
gganbu now, pretty great.
Gganbu, huh?
I thought you said you played this before. Gganbu, come on, you know.
It’s a good friend.
One who you trust a lot.
You share things with them, you see?
Ah!
Your marbles, everything.
A gganbu. I remember now.
I had one in my town too. Used to do everything with him.
Okay, we are gganbu.
[grunts] Yes.
Should we do this to make it official?
[laughs]
Yeah, buddy. Like this.
[both chuckle]
You and me, sir… Oh, no, gganbu, man.
Yeah? Mm.
We’ll go around this whole town, and take all the marbles.
[both chuckle]
[sighs]
[woman on PA] In this game, using your set of ten marbles,
you will play the game of your choice with your partner.
The player who manages to take all ten marbles from their partner wins.
[tense music sting]
Let me repeat the instructions.
Using your set of ten marbles,
play the game of your choice with your partner.
The player who manages to take all ten marbles from their partner wins.
Oh, boy. [inhales sharply]
[chuckles] Shit, man.
[Player 278 breathing shakily]
[somber music]
[exhales]
Sang-woo.
How pretty.
Sir, excuse me. [sighs]
[woman on PA] You will have 30 minutes for this game.
Let the game begins.
[ticking]
Uh, sir, come back.
[breathing heavily]
[ominous music]
[ticking]
Let’s start.
That means one of us ends up dead, doesn’t it?
So both of us should do nothing then? So we should just die?
Or one of us dies so the other can go on.
[Sang-woo] You haven’t played before, right?
[Player 240 sighs]
Since the Korean War, nothing has been this sad.
Tragic.
What should we play then?
Wow. You’re so cold.
As cold as ice.
So you a spy from the North or what?
Hey, stop the dumbshit, girl.
What game are we gonna play?
[background chatter]
You tell me.
These boomers know all these games.
Ten marbles, then we can create our own game.
Hmm. I’ll try to come up with one.
We must be close.
Yes, it was somewhere around here, huh.
Come on, let’s play. Sir, we need to, huh? Come, let’s play this right now.
[Player 1] This is so strange.
It should be here. This is the alley.
[whimpers]
Where… My house, where did it go?
[Gi-hun] Sir, come back.
[Sang-woo exhaling]
So you guess if I’m holding even or odd. Which one you think is in here.
That all makes sense to you?
Even or odd?
What’s that?
[sighs]
Odd is like one, three, five.
And even is two, four, six.
Understand?
Just think it through. Then you wager a few of your own.
[Player 278] Odd.
[Deok-su inhales, exhales]
[marbles clink]
[Player 278 chuckles]
Open your hand.
Ah, shit.
I should have added another one. [chuckles]
Stop giggling, asshole.
Hey, old man, who are you calling asshole, huh?
You really think I’m your minion just ’cause I call you “boss” a few times?
You wanna die, you bastard?
You wanna show me?
Ooh! So, how are you gonna do it?
Hmm? You can’t resort to violence, you puny little idiot dog.
[heavy breathing]
[Player 278 sniggers]
Sir, we have to play now. We gotta start right now.
Play what?
With our marbles. Let’s go.
Why should I?
Look around you. Everybody else is too.
We gotta do this.
No.
That game is for little children.
[grunts]
No. Sir, come back here.
So let’s…
end the game in one round.
All or nothing. A simple bet.
Don’t tell me that you would rather do what they are?
[man 1] Watch. [pants]
Bullseye! Yes.
[man 2] Ah, damn it.
[man 2] My turn.
Okay.
Playing what then?
Why are you in such a hurry?
You’re just dying to kill me, huh?
[sighs]
We’re just playing one round here.
And we got time left too.
Let’s wait till the end.
What are we gonna do before then?
Talk.
About what, though?
Things we never told anybody about I guess.
One of us is gonna die here, so…
doesn’t matter what we tell each other.
No one can really embarrass themselves anymore.
Okay?
[Ali sighs] Even.
[background chatter]
[clock ticking]
[exhales]
What’s your wager?
[Ali] Two.
[inhales, exhales]
[marbles clink]
[suspenseful music]
You’re up now.
I don’t want to do this with you, sir.
Can I stop?
I would like to play with someone else…
Shut up and keep playing with me. Come on.
Sir, he’s not in his right mind, sir.
I think he’s got dementia.
That does mean that he’s out or…
He’s not gonna play. So that means he forfeited, right? Huh?
Ah, shit.
Just one little game, okay? Here, it’ll be…
It’ll be so much fun, sir.
No. I’d better go home now.
I know my house is nearby. It’s somewhere down this alley.
[grunts] Shit! Goddamn it!
Will you please just pull yourself together, old man?
They’ll kill us both if we don’t get started soon!
[sobs]
You got that thing in your head, so I bet you don’t care what happens here,
but I won’t just sit here and die, okay?
Listen, I can’t die!
I need to get out of here.
[Player 1 whimpers]
Don’t yell at me.
[Gi-hun breathes shakily]
All right, I will, but don’t yell.
[sobbing]
…12, 13, 14, 15. Bam, okay.
We’re playing something else.
No way. I’m not gonna stop now.
We already did things how you suggested.
I should get a chance to choose.
[Player 278 breathing shakily]
[mocking] No.
[giggles]
Goddamn it.
You people said we’re equals. What is this?
I think we should play a new game here, huh?
[masked man] Request accepted.
[sighs]
[exhales]
What do you wanna play then, huh?
Even.
[foreboding music]
Do it. Show me.
[Sang-woo sighs]
[inhales sharply]
[exhales]
[chilling music]
[exhales]
You asshole.
You gotta be cheating.
Uh, Sang-woo, why would I do that to you?
How are you winning like this every round?
You keep beating me. How’s that?
The odds should be 50-50. That means you’re cheating!
I didn’t. No! Sir, I wouldn’t do that to you.
You jerk! You pretended not to know how this works!
You said you haven’t done this before!
How did you do it, huh? Spill it!
[gun cocks]
[trembling breath]
[Player 240] Why did you come here from the North?
I thought things were good over here.
And so?
Were you right?
Your family, are they here with you?
Just my brother.
Your parents?
My father got shot trying to swim across the border and drowned.
Our mother…
she was hiding in China and got sent back once the immigration agents found her.
Where is your brother now then?
In a shelter.
[Player 1] Even.
[Gi-hun exhales]
[Player 1] Odd. Even. Odd. Even.
So did I win?
What’s your wager?
[marbles clinking]
[chimes]
[snickers]
Oh…
[marbles clinking]
[Deok-su] We take turns throwing marbles
till you make a shot that lands in the hole I dug over there.
Then what happens?
What happens is that person gets to take everything on the ground.
Ah…
You mean, you want a way to turn this around, huh.
What? You scared?
Not a chance.
I’m not worried at all.
I’m pretty good at getting things in the holes, huh.
You sure about this, hmm?
[snickers]
[ticking]
If you win the money and get out of here, what’s your plan then?
I did this to get a house where I could be with my brother first.
Then I’ll get our mother out of the North.
[scoffs]
Hey, with a price that big, you can do a whole lot more than that.
You gotta want something else too.
Is there anywhere you wanna go?
Jeju Island.
Jeju Island?
There was a thing about it on TV.
It looked exotic. It didn’t look like Korea at all.
[chuckles] Hey.
Don’t you think you should dream bigger, huh?
Do Hawaii. Hold on, go to the Maldives for a while instead.
And have a mojito too.
Mojito?
Like the movie.
Lee Byung-hun’s in it.
“Go to mojito and have a glass of Maldives.”
Really?
[Player 240 chuckles]
Oh, no, we gotta fix that then.
Well, once we’re out of here,
we’ll have a girls’ night out and make mojitos and everything, okay?
[laughs]
Oh.
We can’t both get out of here.
[scoffs]
[Sang-woo sighs]
[Sang-woo crying]
God, I’m so sorry, Ali.
I know you won’t cheat.
But I can’t die this way, I beg you.
They’ll kill my family
if I don’t get out of here.
Sorry, Sang-woo. No.
[Sang-woo sobbing]
[Ali] I’m so sorry.
I have to think of my family.
Hey, Ali. Hey.
Hey, come on, if you help me,
then there’s a way that both of us could live.
You only got this far ’cause I was there.
Like when I gave the bus fare to you and…
I’m the one who got the team through Tug-of-War,
we kept watch at night together.
And just before this begin,
you and I swore that we leave here together, right, Ali?
[sobbing]
Listen, Ali, please.
Trust me, help me and I’ll make sure we get out of here.
Huh?
[sobs]
Okay. What do we do?
[Player 1] What is it? It might be odd.
On the other hand, it could be even.
That must be it.
Come on, hurry up and go.
Odd.
[exhales]
[Player 1 laughing]
Look at that. I won again. [chuckles]
How many are in yours?
[chuckles] Uh…
[chimes]
[gasps] Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
[shaky breathing]
[sighs]
[breathing heavily]
[clock ticking]
[gasps] I, uh…
I still have one.
I still have one more.
[Deok-su inhales]

[Player 278 huffing]
[clock ticking]
[sighs]
[huffing]
[tense music]
Yeah!
[laughs]
[Player 278] Goddamn it.
Okay, here’s what I think.
I think there are gonna be teams out there who can’t decide the winner either.
Mm. Why not?
Think about how you win.
Remember the rules. Thirty minutes to determine who will win or lose.
So think about it.
Some teams aren’t gonna have a winner when time is finally up, right?
You win and you lose, and things just keep going on like that.
That means not every team will have a winner.
What will they do? Eliminate all those teams?
Makes no sense. They have to decide who won. Don’t they?
Yeah.
We’ll play again. We’ll be working together.
We’re teammates. So we’ll just add up everything.
Our team will go play other teams with all 20.
You and I can play as a team
just like we planned to from the start.
You and I will get out of here.
[gunshot]
[both gasp]
[man yelps]
[woman on PA] Player 414, eliminated.
Is that what you want?
You want them to do that to me?
[exhales]
[gunshot]
[grunts]
[woman on PA] Player 2, eliminated.
You ever have to see anyone die before those?
Once, we have this plague go through my town when I was a kid.
As time went on, more and more towns got sick and died.
Soldiers started carrying the dead into piles and lit them on fire.
That’s how my grandpa, grandma and older brother all died.
They burned together.
Damn. Your stories are a bit too dark even for me.
[scoffs]
And you?
What have you seen?
[background chatter]
[gunshot]
[woman on PA] Player 130, eliminated.
First body I saw…
my mother’s.
One day, I came back from school,
and my mom was lying there, dead on the floor.
And next to her…
was my so-called dad with a knife.
The next body that I saw…
that was my dad’s.
And the person standing there holding the knife…
that was me.
He was a goddamn pastor too.
[thrilling music]
And when he hit her and…
did the things he did to me, he would talk to God.
He’d always ask for forgiveness.
He didn’t pray on that day after he killed her.
I was too mad he even forgot, I guess.
[ticking]

[clears throat] Just give me a second.
[muttering]
Odd.
Odd.
[chimes]
[Player 1 grunts]
[exhales]
[Player 1] Which one did you just say?
What?
Can you repeat…
what you said just now?
Even.
I said…
even.
Oh.
I lost this one.
[foreboding music]
[Player 1] Oh.
[foreboding music continues]
We both can win this round? Are you sure?
Hmm.
You’re positive?
Just hear me out first and then turn me down if you like.
I mean it. Here.
Let me just give you this to hold on to, okay?
So you won’t have any guilt around my death.
Your plan…
what is it?
[gunshot]
[woman on PA] Player 68, eliminated.
Well, it will depend on who we’re going against.
We need to know which teams will be here after the round ends.
We better split up to get an idea
how all the other teams are doing to be prepared.
Let’s look for one that seem too young or old,
and check only teams that are still playing games at this point.
Young or old?
Yeah.
That’s what we need.
Like someone who looks your same age
or someone who seems like they’re older than 50.
You go up a few blocks from here, then meet up back up with me later, okay?
Okay, Sang-woo.
Ali.
Huh?
Your pouch there.
It’s too dangerous to keep it out.
These people are bound to go crazy before the end.
Who knows what’ll happen then?
Lose it and we’ll both die. You got that?
Here. I’ll make sure that it’s safe, okay?
What are you gonna do if you win all that money and get out?
I don’t know what I would do.
Someone was waiting
at the prison the day I got out.
I thought he was a creditor who came to collect my dad’s debt.
But he pulled out a card.
That weird card.
I had nowhere else to go, so I…
never thought about what I’d do if I got the money.
Go with you to Jeju Island?
Sorry.
I forgot again.

[Player 278] Oh, damn it.
[gasps] Fuck.
Goddamn it. [breathing heavily]
[tense music]
[huffs]
[tense music continues]
[Player 278 sighs]
[Player 278] I thought that was in. Damn it.
So you’re all out?
Look at that.
One more right here.
[sniggers]
[inhales, exhales] Deok-su.
[sighs] Nice knowing you.
[suspenseful music]
[clicks]
[clinks]
[screams]
That blue that went in, that’s mine, asshole!
[Deok-su cackles]
Shit.
It was nice knowing you, you shithead.
[laughing]
[Player 278 breathing shakily]
Damn it! [panting]
[breathing heavily]
[grunts]
Okay. [panting]
Oh. Oh.
[gasps]
You are all assholes!
[gunshots]
[woman on PA] Player 278, eliminated.
[marbles clinking]
[Sang-woo sighs] Done.
Here.
How’s that?
It feels safer like that, doesn’t it?
[marbles clinking]
Yeah.
When the timer says three minutes, come and meet up with me here.
Then I’ll tell you what we do next.
[Player 1] Odd.
[exhales]
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
[chuckles]
We’ve got three each.
Yeah, but, um, what was your guess?
Huh?
Oh, yeah. But which one did I guess?
You said even was your guess.
Did I…
Did I say that?
Yeah.
[exhales]
That means…
that I lost again.
[gunshot]
[woman on PA] Player 43, eliminated.
[players chattering]
[in Hindi] A team of older people.

[Gi-hun breathing deeply]
[sighs]
[inhales, exhales]
Come on. It’s your turn.
Huh?
Oh. Right.
Here.
[sobs]
[marbles clinking]
Odd.
[Player 1 chuckles]
Oh.
Hold on. What’s today’s date?
My son has his birthday soon.
What day is it? The 24th?
I was going to buy him a toy robot for his birthday.
This year, I need to get him a gift. I completely forgot last year.
I better do that soon. I can’t forget again.
[Player 1 panting]
Oh.
My hand. [sniffs]
[stammers] What was your guess? A-Again?
Odd.
[Gi-hun sobs]
Oh.
Oh.
I have 20 marbles.
The rule said we could play
whatever game to get our opponent to give us theirs,
and the players cannot acquire them using violence.
Well, I made absolutely sure no harm was done.
[indistinct chatter]
[woman on PA] You have three minutes until the game is over.
Three minutes remaining.
[exhales]
[Sae-byeok sighs]
[gunshot]
[woman on PA] Player 158, eliminated.
Let’s do this.
Whoever throws one over there
and makes the shot that comes closest to the wall, wins.
How’s that?
It’s Sae-byeok.
What is?
My name.
Kang Sae-byeok.
Sae-byeok.
Pretty.
And you?
Ji-yeong.
[Sae-byeok] Your family name?
Don’t have one. That’s it.
[Sae-byeok] Who should go first then?
It should be your turn.
Since your number is lower.
[Player 1] Let me see. Darn it. I’m out of marbles.
Mm.
[exhales]
What should I do, huh?
I’d love to keep playing.
Hey. Would you let me
borrow one from you? Just for a while.
Sir, I’m sorry.
[gunshot]
[woman on PA] Player 70, eliminated.
[Player 1] Oh.
Look at that.
Forgot I had another one here.
Not out yet. [chuckles]
One more to go.
[Gi-hun breathing shakily]
Two, four, six, eight.
Two, four, six, eight. Nineteen.
Nineteen.
[gasps]
Uh… Sir, wait. Hold on a second.
Sir, come back!
[exhales]
[somber music]
Hey, what are you doing?
I lost. You won.
Stop. Why the hell would you try to do that?
Hey, butter fingers, what else can I say?
What you said
making sure that I won. Is that what this is?
You think I’ll be thankful that you did this, huh?
Take another throw.
And I still wouldn’t be able to win.
Ugh. Just let me lose this thing in style, okay?
Ji-yeong, that’s bullshit! Stop acting cool and just do a real throw!
[Sae-byeok sobs]
I have nothing.
[Sae-byeok] What?
You got a reason to get out of this place,
but I don’t.
[breathing shakily]
I thought hard about what I’d do.
If I were the one who got out since you asked me earlier.
No matter how hard I thought, though, I got nothing.
[sniffles, sobs]
The one who should have a reason to get back out there…
that’s what’s right.
[Ji-yeong sobs]
[sniffles]
You can do it. Don’t die in here, okay?
And go…
And go meet your mother.
Go get your brother too.
[chuckles] And go to Jeju Island.
[somber music continues]
[Ali] Sang-woo.
Sang-woo, where are you?
Sang-woo? Sang-woo, hello?
I’m done with this side.
Sang-woo!

[sobs quietly]
[Gi-hun sobs]
Sir, please. Let’s just… let’s just play one more time, huh?
Come on, one more round.
Oh.
[Gi-hun] Oh, shit.
It’s this one.
[Player 1 breathing heavily]
Yes, this is it.
My wife and I had this one here.
I raised my son right in here.
Yes. I even had a nice little pond right here in the front yard.
[Gi-hun] Sir, please, you have one marble left.
We’re running out of time, sir.
And I, I would come home from work,
and see my son, his friends were always here and they would all play,
and they wouldn’t even know I was here.
You need to get it together!
Get it together and play with me again right now, understood?
I would hide and I’d go just behind the utility pole there
and take a peek at all of them playing and just watching.
They would always have so much fun.
[sobs]
Sir, please.
[sobbing]
Try to snap out of it, sir.
Oh, God. Sir, I’m begging you.
[Gi-hun sobbing]
Why don’t we do one more and bet it all?
What?
Everything that I still got,
and everything that you’d…
[gasps]
You can’t possibly mean that.
You’re gonna take yours and bet it all,
and I’ll do the same with everything that I still got here.
Okay? Keeps everything fair.
I’ll wager all I got just to get your one?
What kind of nonsense is this?
There’s no sense at all!
So then…
that’s what you did this whole time.
Does tricking your friend like that make sense to you?
[dramatic music]
[exhales]
[Gi-hun breathing heavily]
[dramatic music continues]
[Player 1] Take it.
It’s yours anyway.
We are…
gganbu, aren’t we?
Don’t you remember?
When you and I swore that we were gganbu buddies.
Gganbu always share everything with each other no matter what.
[sobs]
[Player 1] Thank you.
You made all this…
a good experience.
What a great way to go.
[Gi-hun sobs]
Really.
[Player 1 grunts]
[whimpers]
It’s okay.
Hey.
Everything’s okay.
[whimpering]
[Player 1] Mm.
It will be okay.
[ticks, beeps]
[Gi-hun sobs]
[Player 1] Hey, I remember my name now.
My name is Il-nam.
Oh Il-nam.
