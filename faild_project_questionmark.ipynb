      " ['Original release date: September 17, 2021\\nThe sixth and final game is the Squid Game, with Gi-hun on offense and Sang-woo on defense. Gi-hun beats Sang-woo, but refuses to complete the game. He invokes the third clause to end the game, but Sang-woo stabs himself and asks Gi-hun to use the prize money to help Sang-woo’s mother. Gi-hun returns home to find his mother already dead. A year later, Gi-hun is still traumatized by his experience and has barely touched his prize money. One night he receives a gold game invitation card, and in answering it finds Player 001, Oh Il-nam, still alive but dying. Il-nam is one of the VIPs, the “Host” (who co-ran the game alongside the Front Man, In-ho), and the mastermind behind the game operation, which was made to entertain the bored super rich like himself. Il-nam explains that both the poverty-stricken and uber-wealthy lead monotonous lives and he was trying to find a way to derive enjoyment from life. He was also testing whether humanity had any innate goodness left in it, reminding Gi-hun that despite witnessing the bloodshed in the initial game, he and the other participants still returned and sacrificed each other’s lives for the sake of earning the prize money for themselves. The specific games are based on Il-nam’s childhood memories, and he decided to participate himself for nostalgia’s sake. Il-nam asks Gi-hun to play one last game with him, another test to see if humanity has goodness left in it – whether anyone will help a drunk man on the street before midnight; Gi-hun wins but Il-nam dies, though presumably not before he witnesses his loss. Gi-hun snaps out of his stupor and fulfils his promises: he gets Sae-byeok’s brother out of the orphanage and gives Sang-woo’s mother his share of the prize money. Gi-hun is about to leave the country to reconnect with his daughter, but on the way sees someone playing ddakji with the same game recruiter who invited him. Gi-hun takes the man’s card and calls the number, now determined to find out who they are.\\n* * *\\n[dramatic music]\\n[dramatic music continues]\\n[masked manager] Player 218 and Player 456, welcome to the final game. Before we begin, we’ll flip a coin to decide who plays offense or defense. Please choose a shape. Triangle or square.\\nTriangle.\\n[coin clangs, whooshes]\\n[masked manager] It’s triangle. Please choose either offense or defense.\\n[inhales sharply]\\nOffense.\\n[masked manager] Player 456 will play offense. Player 218 will defend.\\n[door clangs]\\n[masked manager] For the final game, you’ll both be playing Squid Game.\\n[VIP 1] Squid Game.\\nWhat an odd name.\\n[Front Man] It was originally a children’s game that was played in Korea many years ago.\\n[VIP 1] Hmm.\\n[masked manager] Let me explain the rules of Squid Game.\\nOne, the attacker must enter the squid shape court, run past the defense, and then tap the area inside the squid’s head with his foot to secure the win.\\nTwo, the defender must block the attacker’s advance and force them outside of the court’s bounds in order to win.\\nThree, if a situation arises, in which either player is unable to continue playing the game, the last one standing will be the winner.\\nA player’s unable to continue.\\nCould you explain that?\\n[masked manager] That would be referring to the player’s death. And now, with that, let the game begin.\\n[suspenseful music]\\n[Front Man] Among all the games that kids played back then, it was the most physical and violent.\\nSo any kind of violence is allowed?\\nSure. There are no restrictions.\\n[suspenseful music continues]\\n[inhales deeply]\\n[breathes deeply]\\n[in English] Why is he hopping on one foot?\\n[Front Man] The attacker is given a handicap. He can only hop on one foot until he crosses the squid’s neck.\\nOh, so the defender tries to block him.\\n[Front Man] Yes. That’s the first challenge of this game.\\n[in Korean] We always used to play this as kids.\\n[heavy breath]\\nWhen we cross… do you remember what we used to call it?\\nShut up. Who cares about all that?\\n[Sang-woo grunts, screams]\\n[Sang-woo coughing]\\n[Sang-woo breathes heavily]\\n[tense music]\\n[grunts]\\nInspector royal.\\n“Inspector royal,” we called it.\\n[rain pattering]\\n[exhales]\\n[thunder rumbles]\\n[rain pouring]\\n[speaking Mandarin]\\n[VIP 2, in English] Mm.

You know she would have died anyway.\\nThat’s bullshit. Stop lying. She could’ve survived. They would’ve treated her.\\nI know what you’re like, okay? You’re the reason that I had to kill her. I knew you two would stop all this, so she didn’t die in there.\\nWas that it? You killed someone because this might end?\\nYeah! You and that girl would have been the majority you needed to get out! Going home without a single cent. I couldn’t do that!\\nShe’s the one who stopped me. ‘Cause I was gonna kill you with this. It’s over. I won’t let you leave here with that money.\\n[scoffs]\\n[tense music]\\n[Gi-hun breathing heavily]\\n[grunts]\\n[both groaning]\\n[both grunting]\\n[Gi-hun grunts]\\n[Sang-woo yelps]\\n[Sang-woo screams]\\n[pants]\\n[Gi-hun breathing heavily]\\n[Sang-woo grunting]\\n[both grunting]\\n[tense music continues]\\n[Sang-woo shouting]\\n[Gi-hun grunts]\\n[Sang-woo moaning]\\n[Sang-woo] You bastard!\\n[yells]\\n[Gi-hun grunts, groans]\\n[both grunting]\\n[suspenseful music]\\n[both groaning]\\n[Gi-hun screams]\\n[Sang-woo] Die!\\n[yelps]\\nDie!\\nGet up!

You… you killed everyone! You killed them. You’re the one who killed them.\\n[panting]\\n[breathes heavily]\\n[panting]\\n[screams]\\n[Gi-hun breathing heavily]\\n[yells]\\n[gasps]\\n[heavy breathing]\\n[tense music]\\n[VIP 1, in English] This game is over.\\n[VIP 2] Yep, that about wraps it up.\\n[Gi-hun grunting]\\n[dramatic music]\\n[breathes heavily]\\n[dramatic music swells]\\nI can’t.\\n[breathes deeply]\\nI wanna end here.\\n[VIP 1] What is he doing?\\n[VIP 2] What the hell?\\n[VIP 3] What’s going on?\\n[in Korean] Clause Three of the agreement.\\nThe players are able to end the game when… the majority agrees.\\n[pants]\\nSo if we both give up now, you have to end it, right?\\n[exhales]\\n[in English] Player 456 wants to stop the game.\\nHe’s giving up the prize money right… right here at the very edge of victory?\\nNo fucking way.\\nSang-woo.\\n[in Korean] I just thought… how they used to call our names when… our moms had made supper for us.\\nThat won’t happen again.\\n[somber music]\\nLet’s go.\\nLet’s go together.\\n[Sang-woo sobbing]\\n[somber music continues]\\nGi-hun.\\nI’m sorry.\\n[gasps]\\n[chokes]\\n[whimpers]\\n[Sang-woo gags]\\nSang-woo!\\n[Gi-hun whimpers] Sang-woo…\\nGi-hun.\\n[whimpering]\\nNo, Sang-woo.

Sang-woo, no…\\n[crying]\\n[Gi-hun screaming]\\n[somber music]\\nYou should celebrate.\\nThat was quite the game there.\\n[Gi-hun] Why? Why did you do it? How can you?\\nYou bet on horses. It’s the same here but… we bet on humans. You’re our horses.\\nI did not expect you to finish your race.\\nWho are you?\\nIt was a dream. Just think of it that way. And it really wasn’t a bad one for you, either.\\n[Gi-hun] Who are you?\\n[In-ho breathes deeply]\\n[Gi-hun] Who are you?\\n[steam hissing]\\n[exhales]\\nWho are you?\\n[gasps]\\n[chokes]\\nWho are you?

I know your mother may want it.\\n[pensive music]\\n[breathes deeply]\\nShe came down with something, I think. She hasn’t come out to work. And it’s been a few days since she’s answered her phone.

Did I do something wrong?\\nHuh? Uh, uh, no. It’s nothing like that, sir. [chuckles] Uh, you’ve got all your money set up in a normal savings account. You weren’t earning all that much interest on it. And recently, our bank began offering these consultations for VIPs looking to expand their financial assets. I wanted to let you know that we’re here to help.\\n[chuckles]\\nI’m sure you’re keeping busy. I just wanted to say…\\nOh. I’m sorry.

That man down there?\\nHe must be drunk… because he’s been sitting there for hours.\\nHe looks homeless too if I had to guess.\\nYou… Were you the one who’s behind it?\\nHe’s going to freeze to death if he stays out there any longer. And no one is going over to help or anything.\\nWhy the hell did you do it?\\n[breathes deeply]\\nWould you help out that guy?\\nAnswer me!\\n[shaky breathing]\\nWhy did you do that to us?\\nYou think that you will stop walking and help that disgusting, stinking drunk, little piece of trash, huh?\\n[shouts angrily] Show me who you are! Why did I get to live and no one else?\\nListen. Let’s play something tonight. That man out there… if he remains out there until midnight, I win. If anyone… goes to help the drunk before then, in that case, you win.\\nCut the crap, okay?\\n[Gi-hun breathing shakily]\\n[Il-nam grunting]\\nI could easily snap your neck right here.\\n[grunts] If you do that, then you won’t get to hear my explanation for all this.\\n[shaky breathing]\\nPlay this game with me and… I’ll give you the… answer to your question.\\n[shaky breathing]\\n[Il-nam grunts]\\n[Gi-hun breathes deeply]\\n[Il-nam breathing heavily]\\n[wind gusting]\\n[clock ticking]\\nAnd if I win…\\n[inhales deeply]\\n…then I’ll kill you without a second thought.\\nWhat will you… bet on it with then?\\nAnything.\\n[inhales sharply]\\nIt doesn’t matter. You might as well take everything I have.\\n[breathing heavily]\\n[ticking]\\n[heart rate monitor beeping]\\nSo then… who are you?\\nI earn… a living, lending out money.\\nYou give money to people for a living…\\n[inhales deeply]\\n…and you get rich doing it?\\nMoney. [chuckles] You know what making money is like. It’s not simple to do.\\nSo then… was any of what you said true or was it all just a lie?\\nOh Il-nam. Is that even your real name, huh?\\n[Il-nam] It is. Yes, that’s real. Oh Il-nam. [inhales] That tumor’s also real. And it also had gotten larger too. That’s true. And the house I used to live with my family in was almost exactly like that one in the alley. That’s all true.\\n[wind gusting]\\n[sighs]\\n[inhales] Can you still… trust anybody to be good even after everything you’ve been through?\\nWhy did you send a card?\\nI heard that all the money you won is just sitting there and that you are still living like you used to. Is it all just because you feel guilty?\\nGuilt? Shut up.\\nYou don’t feel any guilt for what you did, do you?\\nIt’s yours now. That cash is your reward for your hard work and luck. And you have every right to use it now.\\nLife goes by quick.\\nIn one minute… gone in a blink.\\n[wind gusts]\\n[ticking]\\n[heart rate monitor beeping]\\n[breathing deeply]\\n[exhales]\\n[Gi-hun] Why did you do something like this?\\n[Il-nam] Do you know what someone who doesn’t have any money has in common with someone with too much money to know what to do with?\\n[labored breathing]\\nLiving is… no fun for either of them.\\nIf you have too much money, then it… doesn’t matter what you buy, or eat, or drink, or whatever.\\n[chuckles]\\nEverything, well, it all gets boring. All of my clients, started to eventually say the exact same things whenever we talked. Everybody felt… that there was no joy in their lives anymore. And so, we decided to get together. We did a little bit of thinking. What could we all do to… finally have some fun?\\nSome fun? You put us through all of that so you can have fun?\\n[Il-nam] It seems… that you forgot how… no one had to play, and you… all put your signatures on the agreement. And that you all made your decision to come back on your own.\\n[Il-nam breathing heavily]\\n[ticking]\\n[Il-nam] Well, he’s still out there. It looks like you’ve run out of luck. Tell me… you still trust… in humanity being good?\\n[Gi-hun] I wanna know… I wanna know why you joined us?\\n[inhales]\\nOh, well, in my childhood I always had so much fun out doing things with all of my friends. We’d lose track of time for hours. I wanted to just… feel something just one last time before I die. And you are not going to get that feeling if you are just going to spectate. And I desperately wanted that.\\nAnd so… did playing do that then?\\nHell yeah. You asked why I let you live. By joining… and playing with you… I got that chance to… feel again. Thanks to you… I got to remember all these things that I had… forgotten long ago.\\n[ticking]\\nIt had been such a long time… since I… was able to have that much fun.\\n[ticking]\\n[wistful music]\\n[ticking]\\n[police siren blares]\\n[wistful music continues]\\n[Gi-hun gasps]\\nLook at that. There’s someone who cares.\\n[ticking]\\n[chimes]\\n[gasps]\\n[clock chimes]\\n[heart rate monitor flatlining]\\n[clock continues chiming]\\n[wistful music]\\n[Gi-hun] You saw that, didn’t you? You saw that you lost.\\n[clock chimes]\\n[Il-nam sighs, clears throat]\\n[grunts]\\n[exhales]\\nAnd our guests, greet them for me, all right?\\n[Front Man] Of course, sir, but why not do it yourself?\\nBecause I know that I’m not going to have as much fun watching as playing.\\n[dramatic music]\\n[sighs]\\n[dramatic music continues]\\nINCREASE IN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD DEBT RANKING KOREA 2ND GLOBALLY\\n[female reporter] The country’s reported household debt is rapidly on the rise, topping the current global average.

And now, with that, let the game begin.\\n[suspenseful music]\\n[Front Man] Among all the games that kids played back then, it was the most physical and violent.\\nSo any kind of violence is allowed?\\nSure. There are no restrictions.\\n[suspenseful music continues]\\n[inhales deeply]\\n[breathes deeply]\\n[in English] Why is he hopping on one foot?\\n[Front Man] The attacker is given a handicap. He can only hop on one foot until he crosses the squid’s neck.\\nOh, so the defender tries to block him.\\n[Front Man] Yes. That’s the first challenge of this game.\\n[in Korean] We always used to play this as kids.\\n[heavy breath]\\nWhen we cross… do you remember what we used to call it?\\nShut up.

I knew you two would stop all this, so she didn’t die in there.\\nWas that it? You killed someone because this might end?\\nYeah! You and that girl would have been the majority you needed to get out!

Is that even your real name, huh?\\n[Il-nam] It is. Yes, that’s real. Oh Il-nam. [inhales] That tumor’s also real. And it also had gotten larger too. That’s true. And the house I used to live with my family in was almost exactly like that one in the alley. That’s all true.\\n[wind gusting]\\n[sighs]\\n[inhales] Can you still… trust anybody to be good even after everything you’ve been through?\\nWhy did you send a card?\\nI heard that all the money you won is just sitting there and that you are still living like you used to. Is it all just because you feel guilty?\\nGuilt? Shut up.\\nYou don’t feel any guilt for what you did, do you?\\nIt’s yours now. That cash is your reward for your hard work and luck.

All of my clients, started to eventually say the exact same things whenever we talked. Everybody felt… that there was no joy in their lives anymore. And so, we decided to get together. We did a little bit of thinking. What could we all do to… finally have some fun?\\nSome fun? You put us through all of that so you can have fun?\\n[Il-nam] It seems… that you forgot how… no one had to play, and you… all put your signatures on the agreement. And that you all made your decision to come back on your own.\\n[Il-nam breathing heavily]\\n[ticking]\\n[Il-nam] Well, he’s still out there. It looks like you’ve run out of luck. Tell me… you still trust… in humanity being good?\\n[Gi-hun] I wanna know… I wanna know why you joined us?\\n[inhales]\\nOh, well, in my childhood I always had so much fun out doing things with all of my friends. We’d lose track of time for hours. I wanted to just… feel something just one last time before I die. And you are not going to get that feeling if you are just going to spectate. And I desperately wanted that.\\nAnd so… did playing do that then?\\nHell yeah. You asked why I let you live. By joining… and playing with you… I got that chance to… feel again. Thanks to you… I got to remember all these things that I had… forgotten long ago.\\n[ticking]\\nIt had been such a long time… since I… was able to have that much fun.\\n[ticking]\\n[wistful music]\\n[ticking]\\n[police siren blares]\\n[wistful music continues]\\n[Gi-hun gasps]\\nLook at that.
