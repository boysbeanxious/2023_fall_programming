       "['Original release date: September 17, 2021\\nThe sixth and final game is the Squid Game, with Gi-hun on offense and Sang-woo on defense. Gi-hun beats Sang-woo, but refuses to complete the game. He invokes the third clause to end the game, but Sang-woo stabs himself and asks Gi-hun to use the prize money to help Sang-woo’s mother. Gi-hun returns home to find his mother already dead. A year later, Gi-hun is still traumatized by his experience and has barely touched his prize money. One night he receives a gold game invitation card, and in answering it finds Player 001, Oh Il-nam, still alive but dying. Il-nam is one of the VIPs, the “Host” (who co-ran the game alongside the Front Man, In-ho), and the mastermind behind the game operation, which was made to entertain the bored super rich like himself. Il-nam explains that both the poverty-stricken and uber-wealthy lead monotonous lives and he was trying to find a way to derive enjoyment from life. He was also testing whether humanity had any innate goodness left in it, reminding Gi-hun that despite witnessing the bloodshed in the initial game, he and the other participants still returned and sacrificed each other’s lives for the sake of earning the prize money for themselves. The specific games are based on Il-nam’s childhood memories, and he decided to participate himself for nostalgia’s sake. Il-nam asks Gi-hun to play one last game with him, another test to see if humanity has goodness left in it – whether anyone will help a drunk man on the street before midnight; Gi-hun wins but Il-nam dies, though presumably not before he witnesses his loss. Gi-hun snaps out of his stupor and fulfils his promises: he gets Sae-byeok’s brother out of the orphanage and gives Sang-woo’s mother his share of the prize money. Gi-hun is about to leave the country to reconnect with his daughter, but on the way sees someone playing ddakji with the same game recruiter who invited him. Gi-hun takes the man’s card and calls the number, now determined to find out who they are.\\n* * *\\n[dramatic music]\\n[dramatic music continues]\\n[masked manager] Player 218 and Player 456, welcome to the final game. Before we begin, we’ll flip a coin to decide who plays offense or defense. Please choose a shape. Triangle or square.\\nTriangle.\\n[coin clangs, whooshes]\\n[masked manager] It’s triangle. Please choose either offense or defense.\\n[inhales sharply]\\nOffense.\\n[masked manager] Player 456 will play offense. Player 218 will defend.\\n[door clangs]\\n[masked manager] For the final game, you’ll both be playing Squid Game.\\n[VIP 1] Squid Game.\\nWhat an odd name.\\n[Front Man] It was originally a children’s game that was played in Korea many years ago.\\n[VIP 1] Hmm.\\n[masked manager] Let me explain the rules of Squid Game.\\nOne, the attacker must enter the squid shape court, run past the defense, and then tap the area inside the squid’s head with his foot to secure the win.\\nTwo, the defender must block the attacker’s advance and force them outside of the court’s bounds in order to win.\\nThree, if a situation arises, in which either player is unable to continue playing the game, the last one standing will be the winner.\\nA player’s unable to continue.\\nCould you explain that?\\n[masked manager] That would be referring to the player’s death. And now, with that, let the game begin.\\n[suspenseful music]\\n[Front Man] Among all the games that kids played back then, it was the most physical and violent.\\nSo any kind of violence is allowed?\\nSure. There are no restrictions.\\n[suspenseful music continues]\\n[inhales deeply]\\n[breathes deeply]\\n[in English] Why is he hopping on one foot?\\n[Front Man] The attacker is given a handicap. He can only hop on one foot until he crosses the squid’s neck.\\nOh, so the defender tries to block him.\\n[Front Man] Yes. That’s the first challenge of this game.\\n[in Korean] We always used to play this as kids.\\n[heavy breath]\\nWhen we cross… do you remember what we used to call it?\\nShut up. Who cares about all that?\\n[Sang-woo grunts, screams]\\n[Sang-woo coughing]\\n[Sang-woo breathes heavily]\\n[tense music]\\n[grunts]\\nInspector royal.\\n“Inspector royal,” we called it.\\n[rain pattering]\\n[exhales]\\n[thunder rumbles]\\n[rain pouring]\\n[speaking Mandarin]\\n[VIP 2, in English] Mm. It sounds so romantic.\\nWhat’s it mean?\\n[VIP 3] “Good rain knows the best time to fall.”\\nDu Fu.\\n[rain pouring]\\nI put an end to her suffering. You know she would have died anyway.\\nThat’s bullshit. Stop lying. She could’ve survived. They would’ve treated her.\\nI know what you’re like, okay? You’re the reason that I had to kill her. I knew you two would stop all this, so she didn’t die in there.\\nWas that it? You killed someone because this might end?\\nYeah! You and that girl would have been the majority you needed to get out! Going home without a single cent. I couldn’t do that!\\nShe’s the one who stopped me. ‘Cause I was gonna kill you with this. It’s over. I won’t let you leave here with that money.\\n[scoffs]\\n[tense music]\\n[Gi-hun breathing heavily]\\n[grunts]\\n[both groaning]\\n[both grunting]\\n[Gi-hun grunts]\\n[Sang-woo yelps]\\n[Sang-woo screams]\\n[pants]\\n[Gi-hun breathing heavily]\\n[Sang-woo grunting]\\n[both grunting]\\n[tense music continues]\\n[Sang-woo shouting]\\n[Gi-hun grunts]\\n[Sang-woo moaning]\\n[Sang-woo] You bastard!\\n[yells]\\n[Gi-hun grunts, groans]\\n[both grunting]\\n[suspenseful music]\\n[both groaning]\\n[Gi-hun screams]\\n[Sang-woo] Die!\\n[yelps]\\nDie!\\nGet up! Get up! Get up!\\n[grunting]\\n[both groaning]\\n[ominous music]\\n[grunts over screen]\\n[both grunting]\\n[Gi-hun screams]\\n[Sang-woo grunts]\\n[groans]\\n[dramatic music]\\nYou recognized it?\\nIt’s the damn place where they made us play Red Light, Green Light.\\nSo many people played with us, but now they’re dead.\\nEveryone except for us, Gi-hun.\\n[groans]\\nWe… we’ve already come too far to end this now.\\n[screams]\\n[both grunting]\\n[shrieks]\\n[breathing heavily]\\n[Sang-woo cries in pain]\\nSo it was you that killed them. You… you killed everyone! You killed them. You’re the one who killed them.\\n[panting]\\n[breathes heavily]\\n[panting]\\n[screams]\\n[Gi-hun breathing heavily]\\n[yells]\\n[gasps]\\n[heavy breathing]\\n[tense music]\\n[VIP 1, in English] This game is over.\\n[VIP 2] Yep, that about wraps it up.\\n[Gi-hun grunting]\\n[dramatic music]\\n[breathes heavily]\\n[dramatic music swells]\\nI can’t.\\n[breathes deeply]\\nI wanna end here.\\n[VIP 1] What is he doing?\\n[VIP 2] What the hell?\\n[VIP 3] What’s going on?\\n[in Korean] Clause Three of the agreement.\\nThe players are able to end the game when… the majority agrees.\\n[pants]\\nSo if we both give up now, you have to end it, right?\\n[exhales]\\n[in English] Player 456 wants to stop the game.\\nHe’s giving up the prize money right… right here at the very edge of victory?\\nNo fucking way.\\nSang-woo.\\n[in Korean] I just thought… how they used to call our names when… our moms had made supper for us.\\nThat won’t happen again.\\n[somber music]\\nLet’s go.\\nLet’s go together.\\n[Sang-woo sobbing]\\n[somber music continues]\\nGi-hun.\\nI’m sorry.\\n[gasps]\\n[chokes]\\n[whimpers]\\n[Sang-woo gags]\\nSang-woo!\\n[Gi-hun whimpers] Sang-woo…\\nGi-hun.\\n[whimpering]\\nNo, Sang-woo. Don’t talk. [Gi-hun crying]\\nMy mother, go help her.\\nDon’t talk, Sang-woo.\\n[Gi-hun crying]\\nYou have to help her.\\n[Gi-hun] Ah… No. Don’t…\\nSang-woo, don’t… Oh, no! [crying]\\n[wailing]\\nNo! Sang-woo, no…\\n[crying]\\n[Gi-hun screaming]\\n[somber music]\\nYou should celebrate.\\nThat was quite the game there.\\n[Gi-hun] Why? Why did you do it? How can you?\\nYou bet on horses. It’s the same here but… we bet on humans. You’re our horses.\\nI did not expect you to finish your race.\\nWho are you?\\nIt was a dream. Just think of it that way. And it really wasn’t a bad one for you, either.\\n[Gi-hun] Who are you?\\n[In-ho breathes deeply]\\n[Gi-hun] Who are you?\\n[steam hissing]\\n[exhales]\\nWho are you?\\n[gasps]\\n[chokes]\\nWho are you? Who are… [breathing heavily]\\n[evangelist] Believe in Jesus or burn in Hell!\\nYou fool who deny the Lord’s existence, repent now! The day of judgment is upon us! Followers go to Heaven, non-believers burn in Hell! The only thing waiting for you in the afterlife will be fire and pain! Let us repent and kneel down before the Lord!

Did you get into another fight while drinking?\\n[sighs]\\nHold on. Wait right here.\\n[panting]\\nHere’s some mackerel. I know your mother may want it.\\n[pensive music]\\n[breathes deeply]\\nShe came down with something, I think. She hasn’t come out to work. And it’s been a few days since she’s answered her phone. I should’ve stopped by to check on her. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. I mean, I, uh…\\n[gasps] It’s all right. Give your mom any cash you got. She needs it more than I do.\\n[pensive music continues]\\n[Sang-woo’s mom] Gi-hun.\\nBy any chance… have you heard anything recently from Sang-woo?\\nNever mind. You should go.\\n[pensive music continues]\\n[gate clangs]\\n[distant dog barking]\\n[barking continues]\\n[door opens]\\n[Gi-hun breathes deeply]\\nHey, Ma. I’m home.\\n[Gi-hun breathing heavily]\\nHey, Ma. Mom, are you asleep? Hey, Ma. Mom, I’m home. Come on. I came home, Ma.\\n[pensive music]\\nHey, Ma. [shaky breathing] Just, just open your eyes.

I wanted to have a car sent out to you, but…\\nWhy am I here? What’s wrong?\\nUh, well…\\n[sucks teeth, inhales]\\nSo you see, you created your account here quite a while ago and… and you haven’t made that much effort to contact us since.\\nWhat do you mean? Did I do something wrong?\\nHuh? Uh, uh, no. It’s nothing like that, sir. [chuckles] Uh, you’ve got all your money set up in a normal savings account. You weren’t earning all that much interest on it. And recently, our bank began offering these consultations for VIPs looking to expand their financial assets. I wanted to let you know that we’re here to help.\\n[chuckles]\\nI’m sure you’re keeping busy. I just wanted to say…\\nOh. I’m sorry. Did I offend you?\\nCould you help me out with something else?\\nOkay, what can we do?\\nPlease spare me just 10,000 won?\\nWhat?\\nUh…\\nAll right, yeah.

You explain this.\\n[gulps]\\n[Il-nam breathing heavily]\\nYou see him? That man down there?\\nHe must be drunk… because he’s been sitting there for hours.\\nHe looks homeless too if I had to guess.\\nYou… Were you the one who’s behind it?\\nHe’s going to freeze to death if he stays out there any longer. And no one is going over to help or anything.\\nWhy the hell did you do it?\\n[breathes deeply]\\nWould you help out that guy?\\nAnswer me!\\n[shaky breathing]\\nWhy did you do that to us?\\nYou think that you will stop walking and help that disgusting, stinking drunk, little piece of trash, huh?\\n[shouts angrily] Show me who you are! Why did I get to live and no one else?\\nListen. Let’s play something tonight. That man out there… if he remains out there until midnight, I win. If anyone… goes to help the drunk before then, in that case, you win.\\nCut the crap, okay?\\n[Gi-hun breathing shakily]\\n[Il-nam grunting]\\nI could easily snap your neck right here.\\n[grunts] If you do that, then you won’t get to hear my explanation for all this.\\n[shaky breathing]\\nPlay this game with me and… I’ll give you the… answer to your question.\\n[shaky breathing]\\n[Il-nam grunts]\\n[Gi-hun breathes deeply]\\n[Il-nam breathing heavily]\\n[wind gusting]\\n[clock ticking]\\nAnd if I win…\\n[inhales deeply]\\n…then I’ll kill you without a second thought.\\nWhat will you… bet on it with then?\\nAnything.\\n[inhales sharply]\\nIt doesn’t matter. You might as well take everything I have.\\n[breathing heavily]\\n[ticking]\\n[heart rate monitor beeping]\\nSo then… who are you?\\nI earn… a living, lending out money.\\nYou give money to people for a living…\\n[inhales deeply]\\n…and you get rich doing it?\\nMoney. [chuckles] You know what making money is like. It’s not simple to do.\\nSo then… was any of what you said true or was it all just a lie?\\nOh Il-nam. Is that even your real name, huh?\\n[Il-nam] It is. Yes, that’s real. Oh Il-nam. [inhales] That tumor’s also real. And it also had gotten larger too. That’s true. And the house I used to live with my family in was almost exactly like that one in the alley. That’s all true.\\n[wind gusting]\\n[sighs]\\n[inhales] Can you still… trust anybody to be good even after everything you’ve been through?\\nWhy did you send a card?\\nI heard that all the money you won is just sitting there and that you are still living like you used to. Is it all just because you feel guilty?\\nGuilt? Shut up.\\nYou don’t feel any guilt for what you did, do you?\\nIt’s yours now. That cash is your reward for your hard work and luck. And you have every right to use it now.\\nLife goes by quick.\\nIn one minute… gone in a blink.\\n[wind gusts]\\n[ticking]\\n[heart rate monitor beeping]\\n[breathing deeply]\\n[exhales]\\n[Gi-hun] Why did you do something like this?\\n[Il-nam] Do you know what someone who doesn’t have any money has in common with someone with too much money to know what to do with?\\n[labored breathing]\\nLiving is… no fun for either of them.\\nIf you have too much money, then it… doesn’t matter what you buy, or eat, or drink, or whatever.\\n[chuckles]\\nEverything, well, it all gets boring. All of my clients, started to eventually say the exact same things whenever we talked. Everybody felt… that there was no joy in their lives anymore. And so, we decided to get together. We did a little bit of thinking. What could we all do to… finally have some fun?\\nSome fun? You put us through all of that so you can have fun?\\n[Il-nam] It seems… that you forgot how… no one had to play, and you… all put your signatures on the agreement. And that you all made your decision to come back on your own.\\n[Il-nam breathing heavily]\\n[ticking]\\n[Il-nam] Well, he’s still out there. It looks like you’ve run out of luck. Tell me… you still trust… in humanity being good?\\n[Gi-hun] I wanna know… I wanna know why you joined us?\\n[inhales]\\nOh, well, in my childhood I always had so much fun out doing things with all of my friends.

Expecting another riot, Gi-hun’s team builds a barricade, which Deok-su mocks until Gi-hun points out that Deok-su’s teammates have to turn on him sooner or later. That night Gi-hun’s teammates take turns on watch, but Deok-su’s team doesn’t attack. Jun-ho learns about the conspiracy with Player 111 for black market organ harvesting, but the conspiracy ends when the Front Man catches them. Front Man executes the remaining members of the conspiracy, including Player 111, and has a facility-wide manhunt for Jun-ho. Jun-ho breaks into the Front Man’s office and learns that the game has been running for over 30 years, and that his brother, Hwang In-ho, was the winner in 2015.\\n* * *\\n[Mi-nyeo] We’re losing!

       " 'Original release date: September 17, 2021\\nPlayer 111, a doctor, is given information of each game beforehand, and is working with a handful of staff to harvest organs from the dead players. He joins Deok-su’s team by offering game info. Gi-hun realizes that Sang-woo could have helped their team in the previous game. The staff ferment discord among the players and Deok-su kills another player, which only results in the prize money being increased. After lights out, a riot erupts and numerous players are killed. Player 067 joins Gi-hun’s team, who protect her from Deok-su’s gang. When Player 001 begs everyone to stop, the Front Man has the soldiers end the riot. Gi-hun’s team exchange names: Player 199 is Ali Abdul, and Player 067 is Kang Sae-byeok. Player 001, who has a brain tumour, says he remembers his name, but is unable to reveal it due to his worsening condition. In the third game, players are told to form groups of ten. Deok-su, knowing that the upcoming game is tug of war, picks strong men and rejects Player 212, Han Mi-nyeo, who has to join Gi-hun’s team of weaker players.\\n* * *\\n[hurried footsteps]\\n[man panting]\\n[keyboard clacking]\\n[beeps]\\n[zaps]\\n[classical music playing on speakers]\\n[Deok-su] Thank you.\\n[Sang-woo] Gi-hun, wait.\\nHuh?\\nNothing.\\nYou saved me.

It’s a game I know well. And back then, I would always win, even if there was a wrestler on the other team, and it seemed the odds were stuck against us.\\n[Player 1] Listen closely, and I’ll tell you how my team and I were able to win even when it seemed impossible.\\nFirst off, having a good leader is very important.\\nThe person is at the front and keeps an eye on how the other team is performing.\\nAnd the rest of the team focuses on the back of their leader’s head and follows their lead.\\nIf the leader seems weak or looks like their spirit is beginning to falter, then the game is already over.\\nAnd then at the end of the rope, you’ll need to have someone strong and dependable like the anchor of a ship.\\nAfter that, it’s all about how you arrange the rest of your team.\\nIf one player is on the right side of the rope, then the next one should be on the left, all the way down the rope.\\nBoth of your feet should be facing straight forward, and then, hold the rope in your armpits.\\nThat way, everyone can put in all of their strength.\\nFinally, and this is absolutely the most important thing. Once the game begins, for the first ten seconds…\\n[all scream]\\n…you have to hold your ground.\\nYou should lean back, practically lie down.\\nPush your lower abdomen up to the sky, as hard as you can.\\nAnd throw your head back to the point where you can almost see the groin of the person behind you.\\nIf you do that, the other team won’t be able to pull us to their side.\\nJust hold like this for ten seconds.\\nThen the opposing team will start to get frustrated because they are thinking, “Why won’t they budge?”\\nBecause they believed that they were much stronger.\\nIf you can hold out for that long, you will be able to catch a moment in your opponents’ hold, and their rhythm breaks.\\nNow’s our chance!\\n[Team Four rhythmic shouting]\\n[all grunting, shouting]\\n[rhythmic shouting continues]\\n[Team Five grunting]\\nPull it together!\\n[all grunting]\\n[rhythmic shouting]\\n[rhythmic shouting continues]\\n[Mi-nyeo exclaims]\\n[Team Four grunting]\\n[Mi-nyeo yells]\\nWe’re losing! Goddamn it! Do something!\\n[Team Four grunting]\\nGet yourselves together and listen! Let’s try something. Take three steps up when I signal.\\nUp? What now? But that’s the edge!\\nLook, just trust me and they’ll fall!\\nThere’s no way I’ll do that!\\nWe might as well try!\\n[Mi-nyeo] No way! I can’t do it!\\nMove up or you’ll die!\\nOn count of three!\\nOne! Two!\\n[gasps]\\nThree!\\n[screams]\\n[closing theme music]',\n",
       " 'Original release date: September 17, 2021\\nJun-ho hides among the masked staff as they travel to the game’s island location. After waking up in the dorms, the players are more prepared and start forming alliances. Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Player 001 and Player 199 team up, and note that most players returned, including Player 212, who was the first to beg to leave. Player 067 sneaks into the vents and observes staff workers in a kitchen. In the second game, the players are to pick a stamped shape out of a sugar honeycomb snack. Sang-woo identifies the game quickly, using information from Player 067, but doesn’t warn his teammates and picks the simplest shape for himself. Gi-hun completes the game despite having the highest difficulty shape. Player 212 helps Deok-su complete the game and is accepted in his team.\\n* * *\\n[engine revs]\\n[suspenseful music]\\n[crickets creaking]\\n[suspenseful music continues]\\nCHIEF, I CAN’T GO TO THE STATION TODAY.

According to the third clause of the game’s agreement, if the majority agree to end the games, all players will be sent home. The players vote, and Player 001’s deciding vote has all of them sent home safely. Upon returning, Gi-hun goes to the police but no one believes his story except Detective Hwang Jun-ho, whose missing brother received the same card as Gi-hun. The game staff give the players the chance to resume playing, and many return, including: Gi-hun, whose mother needs a medical procedure; Sang-woo, who’s about to be arrested for financial fraud; Player 001, who feels he has nothing to live for; Player 067, who wants to smuggle her parents out of North Korea; Player 199, who attacked his employer for withholding wages; and Player 101, a gangster on the run.

       " 'Original release date: September 17, 2021\\nSeong Gi-hun is down on his luck and has enormous debts with loan sharks. While at a train station, he’s asked by a well-dressed man to play a game of ddakji, where if he wins a round he’ll get 100,000 won, but if he loses then the man will slap his face. After playing, the man gives Gi-hun a card, inviting him to play games with higher stakes. Gi-hun accepts and is taken, while unconscious, to a mysterious location with 455 other players who awaken in a dorm and are identified by numbers on their clothes. The location is managed by masked staff, and overseen by the Front Man, also masked. The players are all in similarly dire financial straits and will be given billions of won in prize money if they win six games over six days. Gi-hun befriends Player 001, an elderly man, and recognizes among the players Cho Sang-woo, a former classmate and businessman, and Player 067, a pickpocket who once stole his money. The first game is Red Light, Green Light where those who lose are gunned down on the spot. Gi-hun, though terrified, is encouraged by Sang-woo to play, and is saved from falling by Player 199. All three are able to complete the game.\\n* * *\\n[drum beating]\\n[drum beating continues]\\n[flute blowing]\\n[man] In my town, we had a game called the “Squid Game.”\\nWe called it that because it’s played in a court shaped like a squid.\\nThe rules are simple.\\nChildren are divided into two groups, the offense and the defense.\\nOnce the game starts, the defense can run around on two feet within bounds,\\nwhile the offense outside the lines are only allowed to hop on one foot.\\nIt’s your mom.\\n[man] But if an attacker cuts through the waist of the squid passing defense,\\nthen they are given freedom to use both feet.\\n[playful music]\\nInspector royal.\\n[man] Inspector royal.\\nFor whatever reason, we called that the inspector royal.\\nWhen we were ready for the final battle,\\nall the attackers gathered at the entrance to the squid.\\nGo.\\n[man] In order to win,\\nthe attackers must tap the small closed-off space\\non the squid’s head with their foot.\\nBut if someone on the defense manages to push you\\noutside of the squid’s boundaries,\\nyou die.\\nThat’s right.

       " 'Original release date: September 17, 2021\\nJun-ho secretly watches the Front Man receive a call, saying that all will be settled before the VIPs arrive. For the fourth game, players are told to pair up. Sang-woo is with Ali, Gi-hun with Player 001, and Sae-byeok with Player 240. As there are an odd number of players, Mi-nyeo is last man standing and taken away. In the game, everyone is told to play a marble game of their choice against their partner, and whoever gets all their partner’s marbles within 30 minutes will win. Sae-byeok and Player 240, Ji-yeong, agree to play a simple all-or-nothing game, but after talking about their lives Ji-yeong decides Sae-byeok has more to live for and lets her win. Sang-woo almost loses, but tricks Ali into giving up his marbles and wins. Gi-hun, about to lose a betting game to Player 001, turns it around by using Player 001’s failing memory against him. Player 001 reveals that he knew that Gi-hun was tricking him the whole time despite his failing condition, but allows Gi-hun to win anyway. Before being killed, Player 001 says that his name is Oh Il-nam.\\n* * *\\nGo away.\\n[masked supervisor] What should we do?\\n[Front Man] Begin the next game.\\n[sighs]\\nSir, let me help.\\n[Player 1 breathing heavily]\\nThanks so much.\\n[chuckles]\\nYou look great, sir.\\n[both chuckle]\\n[“The Blue Danube” playing on speakers]\\n[woman on PA] Attention.

      " ['Original release date: September 17, 2021\\nThe sixth and final game is the Squid Game, with Gi-hun on offense and Sang-woo on defense. Gi-hun beats Sang-woo, but refuses to complete the game. He invokes the third clause to end the game, but Sang-woo stabs himself and asks Gi-hun to use the prize money to help Sang-woo’s mother. Gi-hun returns home to find his mother already dead. A year later, Gi-hun is still traumatized by his experience and has barely touched his prize money. One night he receives a gold game invitation card, and in answering it finds Player 001, Oh Il-nam, still alive but dying. Il-nam is one of the VIPs, the “Host” (who co-ran the game alongside the Front Man, In-ho), and the mastermind behind the game operation, which was made to entertain the bored super rich like himself. Il-nam explains that both the poverty-stricken and uber-wealthy lead monotonous lives and he was trying to find a way to derive enjoyment from life. He was also testing whether humanity had any innate goodness left in it, reminding Gi-hun that despite witnessing the bloodshed in the initial game, he and the other participants still returned and sacrificed each other’s lives for the sake of earning the prize money for themselves. The specific games are based on Il-nam’s childhood memories, and he decided to participate himself for nostalgia’s sake. Il-nam asks Gi-hun to play one last game with him, another test to see if humanity has goodness left in it – whether anyone will help a drunk man on the street before midnight; Gi-hun wins but Il-nam dies, though presumably not before he witnesses his loss. Gi-hun snaps out of his stupor and fulfils his promises: he gets Sae-byeok’s brother out of the orphanage and gives Sang-woo’s mother his share of the prize money. Gi-hun is about to leave the country to reconnect with his daughter, but on the way sees someone playing ddakji with the same game recruiter who invited him. Gi-hun takes the man’s card and calls the number, now determined to find out who they are.\\n* * *\\n[dramatic music]\\n[dramatic music continues]\\n[masked manager] Player 218 and Player 456, welcome to the final game.

And now, with that, let the game begin.\\n[suspenseful music]\\n[Front Man] Among all the games that kids played back then, it was the most physical and violent.\\nSo any kind of violence is allowed?\\nSure. There are no restrictions.\\n[suspenseful music continues]\\n[inhales deeply]\\n[breathes deeply]\\n[in English] Why is he hopping on one foot?\\n[Front Man] The attacker is given a handicap. He can only hop on one foot until he crosses the squid’s neck.\\nOh, so the defender tries to block him.\\n[Front Man] Yes. That’s the first challenge of this game.\\n[in Korean] We always used to play this as kids.\\n[heavy breath]\\nWhen we cross… do you remember what we used to call it?\\nShut up.

I knew you two would stop all this, so she didn’t die in there.\\nWas that it? You killed someone because this might end?\\nYeah! You and that girl would have been the majority you needed to get out! Going home without a single cent. I couldn’t do that!\\nShe’s the one who stopped me. ‘Cause I was gonna kill you with this. It’s over.

He joins Deok-su’s team by offering game info. Gi-hun realizes that Sang-woo could have helped their team in the previous game. The staff ferment discord among the players and Deok-su kills another player, which only results in the prize money being increased. After lights out, a riot erupts and numerous players are killed. Player 067 joins Gi-hun’s team, who protect her from Deok-su’s gang. When Player 001 begs everyone to stop, the Front Man has the soldiers end the riot. Gi-hun’s team exchange names: Player 199 is Ali Abdul, and Player 067 is Kang Sae-byeok. Player 001, who has a brain tumour, says he remembers his name, but is unable to reveal it due to his worsening condition. In the third game, players are told to form groups of ten. Deok-su, knowing that the upcoming game is tug of war, picks strong men and rejects Player 212, Han Mi-nyeo, who has to join Gi-hun’s team of weaker players.\\n* * *\\n[hurried footsteps]\\n[man panting]\\n[keyboard clacking]\\n[beeps]\\n[zaps]\\n[classical music playing on speakers]\\n[Deok-su] Thank you.\\n[Sang-woo] Gi-hun, wait.\\nHuh?\\nNothing.\\nYou saved me.

It’s a game I know well. And back then, I would always win, even if there was a wrestler on the other team, and it seemed the odds were stuck against us.\\n[Player 1] Listen closely, and I’ll tell you how my team and I were able to win even when it seemed impossible.\\nFirst off, having a good leader is very important.\\nThe person is at the front and keeps an eye on how the other team is performing.\\nAnd the rest of the team focuses on the back of their leader’s head and follows their lead.\\nIf the leader seems weak or looks like their spirit is beginning to falter, then the game is already over.\\nAnd then at the end of the rope, you’ll need to have someone strong and dependable like the anchor of a ship.\\nAfter that, it’s all about how you arrange the rest of your team.\\nIf one player is on the right side of the rope, then the next one should be on the left, all the way down the rope.\\nBoth of your feet should be facing straight forward, and then, hold the rope in your armpits.\\nThat way, everyone can put in all of their strength.\\nFinally, and this is absolutely the most important thing. Once the game begins, for the first ten seconds…\\n[all scream]\\n…you have to hold your ground.\\nYou should lean back, practically lie down.\\nPush your lower abdomen up to the sky, as hard as you can.\\nAnd throw your head back to the point where you can almost see the groin of the person behind you.\\nIf you do that, the other team won’t be able to pull us to their side.\\nJust hold like this for ten seconds.\\nThen the opposing team will start to get frustrated because they are thinking, “Why won’t they budge?”\\nBecause they believed that they were much stronger.\\nIf you can hold out for that long, you will be able to catch a moment in your opponents’ hold, and their rhythm breaks.\\nNow’s our chance!\\n[Team Four rhythmic shouting]\\n[all grunting, shouting]\\n[rhythmic shouting continues]\\n[Team Five grunting]\\nPull it together!\\n[all grunting]\\n[rhythmic shouting]\\n[rhythmic shouting continues]\\n[Mi-nyeo exclaims]\\n[Team Four grunting]\\n[Mi-nyeo yells]\\nWe’re losing! Goddamn it! Do something!\\n[Team Four grunting]\\nGet yourselves together and listen! Let’s try something. Take three steps up when I signal.\\nUp? What now? But that’s the edge!\\nLook, just trust me and they’ll fall!\\nThere’s no way I’ll do that!\\nWe might as well try!\\n[Mi-nyeo] No way!

After waking up in the dorms, the players are more prepared and start forming alliances. Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Player 001 and Player 199 team up, and note that most players returned, including Player 212, who was the first to beg to leave. Player 067 sneaks into the vents and observes staff workers in a kitchen. In the second game, the players are to pick a stamped shape out of a sugar honeycomb snack. Sang-woo identifies the game quickly, using information from Player 067, but doesn’t warn his teammates and picks the simplest shape for himself. Gi-hun completes the game despite having the highest difficulty shape.

While at a train station, he’s asked by a well-dressed man to play a game of ddakji, where if he wins a round he’ll get 100,000 won, but if he loses then the man will slap his face. After playing, the man gives Gi-hun a card, inviting him to play games with higher stakes. Gi-hun accepts and is taken, while unconscious, to a mysterious location with 455 other players who awaken in a dorm and are identified by numbers on their clothes. The location is managed by masked staff, and overseen by the Front Man, also masked. The players are all in similarly dire financial straits and will be given billions of won in prize money if they win six games over six days. Gi-hun befriends Player 001, an elderly man, and recognizes among the players Cho Sang-woo, a former classmate and businessman, and Player 067, a pickpocket who once stole his money. The first game is Red Light, Green Light where those who lose are gunned down on the spot. Gi-hun, though terrified, is encouraged by Sang-woo to play, and is saved from falling by Player 199. All three are able to complete the game.\\n* * *\\n[drum beating]\\n[drum beating continues]\\n[flute blowing]\\n[man] In my town, we had a game called the “Squid Game.”\\nWe called it that because it’s played in a court shaped like a squid.\\nThe rules are simple.\\nChildren are divided into two groups, the offense and the defense.\\nOnce the game starts, the defense can run around on two feet within bounds,\\nwhile the offense outside the lines are only allowed to hop on one foot.\\nIt’s your mom.\\n[man] But if an attacker cuts through the waist of the squid passing defense,\\nthen they are given freedom to use both feet.\\n[playful music]\\nInspector royal.\\n[man] Inspector royal.\\nFor whatever reason, we called that the inspector royal.\\nWhen we were ready for the final battle,\\nall the attackers gathered at the entrance to the squid.\\nGo.\\n[man] In order to win,\\nthe attackers must tap the small closed-off space\\non the squid’s head with their foot.\\nBut if someone on the defense manages to push you\\noutside of the squid’s boundaries,\\nyou die.\\nThat’s right.

For the fourth game, players are told to pair up. Sang-woo is with Ali, Gi-hun with Player 001, and Sae-byeok with Player 240. As there are an odd number of players, Mi-nyeo is last man standing and taken away. In the game, everyone is told to play a marble game of their choice against their partner, and whoever gets all their partner’s marbles within 30 minutes will win. Sae-byeok and Player 240, Ji-yeong, agree to play a simple all-or-nothing game, but after talking about their lives Ji-yeong decides Sae-byeok has more to live for and lets her win. Sang-woo almost loses, but tricks Ali into giving up his marbles and wins. Gi-hun, about to lose a betting game to Player 001, turns it around by using Player 001’s failing memory against him. Player 001 reveals that he knew that Gi-hun was tricking him the whole time despite his failing condition, but allows Gi-hun to win anyway. Before being killed, Player 001 says that his name is Oh Il-nam.\\n* * *\\nGo away.\\n[masked supervisor] What should we do?\\n[Front Man] Begin the next game.\\n[sighs]\\nSir, let me help.\\n[Player 1 breathing heavily]\\nThanks so much.\\n[chuckles]\\nYou look great, sir.\\n[both chuckle]\\n[“The Blue Danube” playing on speakers]\\n[woman on PA] Attention.
